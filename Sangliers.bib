  abstract = {The duality of the skeleton as both a biological and cultural entity has formed the theoretical basis of bioarchaeology. In recent years bioarchaeological studies have stretched the early biocultural concept with the adoption of life course approaches in their study design and analyses, making a significant contribution to how we think about the role of postnatal plasticity. Life course theory is a conceptual framework used in several scientific fields of biology and the social sciences. Studies that emphasize life course approaches in the examination of bone morphology in the past are united in their interrogation of human life as a result of interrelated and cumulative events over not only the timeframe of individuals, but also over generations at the community level. This article provides an overview of the theoretical constructs that utilize the life course concept, and a discussion of the different ways these theories have been applied to thinking about trajectories of bone morphology in the past, specifically highlighting key recent studies that have used life course approaches to understand the influence of growth, stress, diet, activity, and aging on the skeleton. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the scope of contemporary bioarchaeological studies that illuminate the importance of environmental and behavioral influence on bone morphology. Understanding how trajectories of bone growth and morphology can be altered and shaped over the life course is critical not only for bioarchaeologists, but also researchers studying bone morphology in living nonhuman primates and fossil primate skeletons.

  abstract = {In this paper an ethnoarchaeological analysis of pig husbandry in central-eastern Sardinia is presented. This research further develops a previous project with a similar focus undertaken in Corsica and northern Sardinia. Results presented here are based on ten interviews with local central-eastern Sardinian herders, and various other observations made in the area. In the study area, the typical Sardinian pig breed is kept mainly free-range, and its style of keeping bears clear relationships with the recent, and possibly more distant, past. Pigs and other livestock are typically kept on a plateau, where they live more or less permanently. Herders regularly move from the lowland villages, where they spend time with their families, to the highlands, where they tend the animals. Though no longer practiced, the long distant movement of pigs – including transhumance – occurred until the 1970s and was aimed at reaching regions where better pig pasturing would seasonally be available. The evidence collected is compared with results from the previous phase of the project, as well as with similar work undertaken by other researchers in Greece and Spain. Mobility patterns of humans and animals have been highlighted as part of this project and their potential for archaeological interpretation is emphasised.},

  abstract = {A large assortment of skulls and skeletons of recent wild boar (Sus scrofa) from across the world has been used to collect tooth and bone measurements that can be compared to those from archaeological specimens. The data provide useful information for a reconstruction of the Holocene history of the species. The evidence collected so far highlights the great variability of the species and provides a baseline to be used for the interpretation of ancient material. It is shown that not only the size, but also the shape of teeth and mandibles can help in highlighting patterns of variability in wild boar from different areas. A number of geographic trends are identified in the variation of S. scrofa across its range, mainly concerning the differentiation of insular forms, and the existence of South–North and West–East clines. Other factors such as hybridisation with domestic stock, feralisation and human-induced movement of animals may also play an important role. A comparison with ancient material emphasises the existence of similarities as well as differences between modern and ancient populations. Although some of the geographic trends identified on the basis of the analysis of modern material seem to date back to early Holocene times, the morphological history of the species appears to be complex, and in more than one area fluctuations in body size seem to have occurred.},

  abstract = {Regular exercisers have lower fracture risk, despite modest effects of exercise on bone mineral content (BMC). Exercise may produce localized cortical and trabecular bone changes that affect bone strength independently of BMC. We previously demonstrated that brief, daily unilateral hopping exercises increased femoral neck BMC in the exercise leg versus the control leg of older men. This study evaluated the effects of these exercises on cortical and trabecular bone and its 3D distribution across the proximal femur, using clinical CT. Fifty healthy men had pelvic CT scans before and after the exercise intervention. We used hip QCT analysis to quantify BMC in traditional regions of interest and estimate biomechanical variables. Cortical bone mapping localized cortical mass surface density and endocortical trabecular density changes across each proximal femur, which involved registration to a canonical proximal femur model. Following statistical parametric mapping, we visualized and quantified statistically significant changes of variables over time in both legs, and significant differences between legs. Thirty?four men aged mean (SD) 70 (4) years exercised for 12?months, attending 92\% of prescribed sessions. In traditional regions of interest, cortical and trabecular BMC increased over time in both legs. Cortical BMC at the trochanter increased more in the exercise than control leg, whereas femoral neck buckling ratio declined more in the exercise than control leg. Across the entire proximal femur, cortical mass surface density increased significantly with exercise (2.7\%; p\,\&lt;\,0.001), with larger changes (\&gt;\,6\%) at anterior and posterior aspects of the femoral neck and anterior shaft. Endocortical trabecular density also increased (6.4\%; p\,\&lt;\,0.001), with localized changes of\,\&gt;\,12\% at the anterior femoral neck, trochanter, and inferior femoral head. Odd impact exercise increased cortical mass surface density and endocortical trabecular density, at regions that may be important to structural integrity. These exercise?induced changes were localized rather than being evenly distributed across the proximal femur. © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

  abstract = {Despite its clear functional role in hock (ankle) plantarflexion, the bovid calcaneus has been understudied with respect to the functional constraints imposed by locomotion in differing habitats, the allometric influence of inter-specific body size differences, and phylogenetic signal. This study uses a comparative sample of extant bovid species to shed light on the evolution of bovid calcaneal morphology. I measured eight linear measurements on 204 calcaneus specimens representing 41 extant bovid species. Using a morphological body size proxy validated against published species-mean body mass estimates, I performed Ordinary Least Squares regression to examine the allometric relationships of each measurement with body size. I classified each bovid species to a preferred habitat type based on published literature, and performed Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) to test for differences in morphology between bovid taxa with different preferred habitats while considering evolutionary relatedness. I visualized morphological differences between taxa using Principal Components Analysis plotted in a phylomorphospace. Results demonstrate that several measurements of the bovid calcaneus have an allometric relationship to body size. The functional length of the calcaneus scales with negative allometry, which likely maintains a comparable safety factor within the calcaneal tuber at larger body sizes. While open-habitat bovids have relatively shorter calcaneal tubers, this difference is not significant when controlling for the influence of body size and phylogenetic signal using PGLS. Among bovid tribes that have a deep evolutionary history of adaptation to open habitats, Antilopini have relatively longer calcaneal tubers than Alcelaphini or Hippotragini, which may reflect the unique importance of stotting behavior in predator avoidance among antelopins. Overall, the morphology of the bovid calcaneus has been shaped by a complex interaction of phylogenetic and body-size constraints as well as adaptation to modes of predator avoidance mediated by preferred habitat.},

  abstract = {This study aims to contribute to our knowledge of food production during the early the neolithic in north?eastern France. Based on the analyses of groups of animal remains collected on linear band ceramic (Ruban?) sites of the Alsace and Champagne regions, precisions are given on the role of different animal species as well as their management within the food supply system of the first agro?pastoral communities in this region. Brought into evidence is the marginal role of hunting and allows to put aside ideas concerning its evolution during the linear band ceramic period. It also establishes that meat consumption was essentially assured by the exploitation of domesticated livestock. Cattle represent the principal resource. The rearing of pig on most sites indicates a more important development than that of goats and constitutes the second source of meat supply. The role of the different domesticated species evolved during the linear band ceramic period and is marked by a diversified exploitation of domesticated livestock resources.

  abstract = {A relationship exists between mechanical loading and bone morphology. Although studies show a relationship between trabecular bone morphology and locomotor strategy in mammals, none of them have studied trabecular bone morphology in felid species occupying disparate and overlapping habitats. We investigate trabecular bone volume fraction (BVF) in the femoral and humeral heads, and distal tibia of four felid species (mountain lions, jaguars, cheetahs, and leopards) to identify whether there is a relationship between BVF and locomotor behavior. This study's goals are to identify whether felid species with high daily travel distance or large home range size have greater BVF compared with those with small daily travel distance or home range size, and whether BVF is correlated among the three elements of the fore and hindlimb studied. We quantified BVF in micro- and peripheral computed tomography images and found no significant differences across species in the femoral and humeral head (p {$>$} 0.05). However, in the distal tibia, results showed that leopards, mountain lions, and cheetahs have significantly greater (p {$<$} 0.05) BVF than jaguars. Despite differences in home range size and daily travel distance, the proximal elements did not reflect differences in BVF; however, the distal-most element did, suggesting decreased loading among jaguars. These findings suggest that the observed pattern of trabecular bone morphology is potentially due to the diversity in locomotor strategy of the forelimb. Additionally, these results imply that neither home range size nor daily travel distance are clear indicators of activity levels. A cautious approach is warranted in studying how loading influences trabecular morphology.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe long bones and associated musculature play a prominent role in the support and movement of the body and are expected to reflect the associated mechanical demands. But in addition to the functional response to adaptive changes, the conjoined effects of phylogenetic, structural and developmental constraints also shape the animal's body. In order to minimise the effect of the aforementioned constraints and to reveal the biomechanical adaptations in the musculoskeletal system to locomotor mode, we here study the forelimb of two closely related martens: the arboreal pine marten (Martes martes) and the more terrestrial stone marten (Martes foina), focusing on their forelimb muscle anatomy and long bone microanatomy; and, especially, on their covariation. To do so, we quantified muscle data and bone microanatomical parameters and created 3D and 2D maps of the cortical thickness distribution for the three long bones of the forelimb. We then analysed the covariation of muscle and bone data, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results reveal that species-specific muscular adaptations are not clearly reflected in the microanatomy of the bones. Yet, we observe a global thickening of the bone cortex in the radius and ulna of the more arboreal pine marten, as well a stronger flexor muscle inserting on its elbow. We attribute these differences to variation in their locomotor modes. Analyses of our 2D maps revealed a shift of cortical thickness distribution pattern linked to ontogeny, rather than species-specific patterns. We found that although intraspecific variation is not negligible, species distinction was possible when taking muscular and bone microanatomical data into consideration. Results of our covariation analyses suggest that the muscle-bone correlation is linked to ontogeny rather than to muscular strength at zones of insertion. Indeed, if we find a correlation between cortical thickness distribution and the strength of some muscles in the humerus, that is not the case for the others and in the radius and ulna. Cortical thickness distribution appears rather linked to bone contact zones and ligament insertions in the radius and ulna, and to some extent in the humerus. We conclude that inference on muscle from bone microanatomy is possible only for certain muscles in the humerus.},

The wild boars’ ecological niche and the scale of pig husbandry were investigated during a stable isotope study of the Gumelni?a A2 occupations at Bordu?ani-Popin?, H?r?ova-tell and Vit?ne?ti-M?gurice. Results from the bone collagen ?15N and ?13C analysis suggested that the wild boars did not inhabit dense forests, in any of these locations. The emerging picture is of small-scale pig husbandry involving household management: pigs being fed leftovers and/or by-products of human activities. At Vit?ne?ti, previous work involving geometric morphometrics on suid molars evidenced, besides the two expected groups of small domestic pigs and large specimens with wild molar shape (i.e. wild boar), the presence of specimens with large size and domestic shape molars, whose relationship with the human community was unclear. Results from the combined geometric morphometric and stable isotope analyses, suggested that the large specimens with domestic molar shape lived in close proximity to the wild ecosystem. They were probably not part of the domestic stock, but belonged to a feral population and were acquired through hunting.},

Consequently, each zone of the metaphysis includes mineralized tissues of various compositions and ages, identifiable by their different mineralization densities. Microradiography of pieces of the growing skeleton in several animal species shows that the same organization is not only present in long and short tubular bones but also in many other such as the pelvis and scapula, cuboid bones like the calcaneum and talus, and cartilaginous bones at the base of the skull. This suggests that there is no difference between the osteogenesis pattern of these bones and tubular ones. The problem of identifying the factors generating such metaphyseal organization is raised.},

Here we demonstrate in chimpanzees and humans a highly predictable and sensitive relationship between the orientation of the ankle joint during loading and the principal orientation of trabecular bone struts in the distal tibia that function to withstand compressive forces within the joint. Analyses of the orientation of these struts using microCT scans in a sample of fossil tibiae from the site of Sterkfontein, of which two are assigned to Australopithecus africanus, indicate that these hominins primarily loaded their ankles in a relatively extended posture like modern humans and unlike chimpanzees. In other respects, however, trabecular properties in Au africanus are distinctive, with values that mostly fall between those of chimpanzees and humans. These results indicate that Au. africanus, like Homo, walked with an efficient, extended lower limb.},

Two groups of sheep were exercised at a trot, 15min/day for 34days on an inclined (7°) or level (0°) treadmills. Incline trotting caused the sheep to extend their tarsal joints by 3–4.5° during peak loading (P{$<$}0.01) but has no effect on carpal joint angle (P=0.984). Additionally, tarsal joint angle in the incline group sheep were maintained more extended throughout the day using elevated platform shoes on their forelimbs. A third “sedentary group” group did not run but wore platform shoes throughout the day. As predicted by Wolff's law, trabecular orientation in the distal tibia (tarsal joint) were more obtuse by 2.7 to 4.3° in the incline group compared to the level group; trabecular orientation was not significantly different in the sedentary and level groups. In addition, trabecular orientations in the distal radius (carpal joint) of the sedentary, level and incline groups did not differ between groups, and were aligned almost parallel to the radius long axis, corresponding to the almost straight carpal joint angle at peak loading. Measurements of other trabecular bone parameters revealed additional responses to loading, including significantly higher bone volume fraction (BV/TV), Trabecular number (Tb.N) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), lower trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp), and less rod-shaped trabeculae (higher structure model index, SMI) in the exercised than sedentary sheep. Overall, these results demonstrate that trabecular bone dynamically adjusts and realigns itself in very precise relation to changes in peak loading direction, indicating that Wolff's law is not only accurate but also highly sensitive.},

The primitive pattern is exemplified in the foot of the Echidna, in which the ankle joint is ovoid in type and both the talus and calcaneus are able to rotate to produce cupping of the sole.

  abstract = {Bovid astragali are one of the most commonly preserved bones in the fossil record. Accordingly, astragali are an important target for studies seeking to predict the habitat preferences of fossil bovids based on bony anatomy. However, previous work has not tested functional hypotheses linking astragalar morphology with habitat while controlling for body size and phylogenetic signal. This article presents a functional framework relating the morphology of the bovid astragalus to habitat-specific locomotor ecology and tests four hypotheses emanating from this framework. Highly cursorial bovids living in structurally open habitats are hypothesized to differ from their less cursorial closedhabitat dwelling relatives in having (1) relatively short astragali to maintain rotational speed throughout the camming motion of the rotating astragalus, (2) a greater range of angular excursion at the hock, (3) relatively larger joint surface areas, and (4) a more pronounced “spline-and-groove” morphology promoting lateral joint stability. A diverse sample of 181 astragali from 50 extant species was scanned using a Next Engine laser scanner. Species were assigned to one of four habitat categories based on the published ecological literature. A series of 11 linear measurements and three joint surface areas were measured on each astragalus. A geometric mean body size proxy was used to size-correct the measurement data. Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) was used to test for differences between habitat categories while controlling for body size differences and phylogenetic signal. Statistically significant PGLS results support Hypotheses 1 and 2 (which are not mutually exclusive) as well as Hypothesis 3. No support was found for Hypothesis 4. These findings confirm that the morphology of the bovid astragalus is related to habitat-specific locomotor ecology, and that this relationship is statistically significant after controlling for body size and phylogeny. Thus, this study validates the use of this bone as an ecomorphological indicator. J. Morphol. 275:1201–1216, 2014. VC 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Wild boar are now present on all continents except Antarctica and can greatly affect community structure and ecosystem function. Their destructive feeding habits, primarily rooting disturbance, can reduce plant cover, diversity, and regeneration. Furthermore, predation and habitat destruction by boar can greatly affect animal communities. Effects of wild boar on fungi and aquatic communities are scarcely studied, and soil properties and processes seem more resistant to disturbance. Wild boar also affect humans’ economy as they cause crop damage and transmit diseases to livestock and wildlife. In this review, we found that most of the published literature examines boar effects in their introduced range and little is available from the native distribution. Because most of the research describes direct effects of wild boar on plant communities and predation on some animal communities, less is known about indirect effects on ecosystem function. Finally, predictive research and information on ecosystem recovery after wild boar removal are scarce. We identified research gaps and urge the need to lower wild boar densities. Identifying commonalities among wild boar impacts on native ecosystems across its introduced range will help in the design of management strategies.},

  abstract = {The Shungura Formation in southwestern Ethiopia preserves a long and relatively continuous record of eastern African mammalian and hominin evolution. This study reconstructs habitat preferences of the Shungura Formation bovids from ca. 3.4–1.9~Ma (million years ago), based on the ecomorphology of fossil bovid astragali. Habitat predictions are made using a Discriminant Function Analysis informed by functional analysis of the astragalus that controls for body size and phylogenetic signal. The high abundance of astragali in the Shungura record allows for habitat reconstructions on sub-unit timescales, rather than aggregating samples at the level of geological member. During much of the time period examined, the lower Omo Valley was dominated by relatively mesic habitats in close proximity to the ancestral Omo River. Previous research has suggested that environmental change at ?2.85~Ma caused significant habitat change at Shungura, but the astragalar data do not support major habitat change at this time. However, there are significant fluctuations in inferred habitats, with more open habitats indicated in sub-units C-08 and C-09 (?2.56~Ma), and in unit F-01 (just after 2.36~Ma). The cause of sub-unit fluctuations in habitat signal is difficult to determine, but local factors, including spatial habitat heterogeneity around the river channel and in its floodplain, may play a contributing role. In the light of faunal evidence from elsewhere in the greater Omo-Turkana Basin, hominins in the area likely had access to a variety of heterogeneous habitats.},

A categorization of weathering characteristics into six stages, recognizable on descriptive criteria, provides a basis for investigation of weathering rates and processes. The time necessary to achieve each successive weathering stage has been calibrated using known-age carcasses. Most bones decompose beyond recognition in 10 to 15 yr. Bones of animals under 100 kg and juveniles appear to weather more rapidly than bones of large animals or adults. Small-scale rather than widespread environmental factors seem to have greatest influence on weathering characteristics and rates. Bone weathering is potentially valuable as evidence for the period of time represented in recent or fossil bone assemblages, including those on archeological sites, and may also be an important tool in censusing populations of animals in modern ecosystems.},

Results indicate that the age when the eyes are fully open, when the response to sound first appears and when exploratory behaviour is first shown in strange surroundings is 3 weeks, on average. The age when the socialization period starts appears to be 20–25 days old. The optimum period of the formation of primary social bonds appears to be 30–35 days, when maximum exploration in a novel situation is shown. The 40–45 days period appears to be the upper boundary of primary socialization in unselected foxes because pups show fear in response to novel stimuli, which prevents exploration. In pups from the population of domesticated foxes, the sensitive period of socialization is prolonged to over 60–65 days old.},

In vivo and in situ principal compressive strains (?800 to ?2000 ?e) were found to be aligned (mean 161 ± 7°) close to the preferred alignment (160°) of underlying trabeculae within the calcaneal metaphysis [a second trabecular arcade was closely aligned (70°) with the direction (71°) of principal tensile strain]. This finding represents quantitative verification of Wolffs trajectorial theory of trabecular alignment. These trabecular alignments, as measured by trabecular anisotropy (TbAn, the ratio of horizontal: vertical intercepts), remained unchanged (p {$>$} 0.05) after 8 weeks of disuse. However, trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV, ?35\%), trabecular thickness (TbTh, ?25\%), and trabecular number (TbN, ?16\%) were reduced for the tenotomized calcaneii relative to their contralateral controls (p {$<$} 0.001 to {$<$} 0.003). The reduction in trabecular number was associated with a corresponding increase in trabecular spacing (TbSp, +30\%). Together, these results suggest that once trabecular alignment is established during growth (along the directions of principal strain during locomotion), it is not altered when functional strains are removed.},

This has been dubbed Bergmann's rule in his honour. However, more than 150 years on, we appear to be little closer to a general understanding of the rule, or even to any consensus as to whether it exists. This is due in large part to confusion about the taxonomic level at which the rule is considered to operate, and to the conflation of pattern and mechanism. In this paper, we attempt to resolve this confusion by highlighting its sources, and by providing a definition of Bergmann's rule that is practical and useful, yet that retains the essential features of its original formulation. We conclude by briefly reviewing the mechanisms proposed to explain Bergmann's rule as we define it.},

  abstract = {The exploitation strategies of faunal resources have figured prominently in discussions of the timing and nature of the beginning of modern human behaviour. These strategies have focused on ability to make intensive use of seasonal resources, ability to hunt large or dangerous animals and capacity to exploit small prey, specifically fast-running and flying animals. On this basis, the systematic use of small animals for food at the pre-Upper Palaeolithic moments has been an important debate topic in recent decades. Occasional anthropogenic evidences concerning these animals dates back to the Plio-Pleistocene chronologies in Africa. Nevertheless, several authors state that the small animals began to be important in the human diet from at least the early Middle Palaeolithic in the Mediterranean Basin. From this perspective, this paper discusses the human use of small prey (rabbits, birds and tortoises) in the stratigraphical sequence of Bolomor Cave (Valencia, Spain). This site contains a sedimentary deposit composed of seventeen stratigraphical levels ranging from MIS 9 to MIS 5e (c. 350–100 ka). The evidence of anthropogenic processing of small prey is documented from the earliest moments of the site occupation (level XVII) in form of cutmarks, intentional breakage, human toothmarks, and burning patterns, depending on the archaeological level. The use of small animals, attached to the large game identified in the site, indicate generalist human behaviour based on a broad spectrum diet. In general, the aim of this study is to provide data on the subsistence strategies of the Middle Pleistocene hominids from Bolomor Cave and to contribute to the discussion topic related to the human consumption of small prey in early moments.},

This technique, widely developed in the medical field, allows the bi-dimensional, planar representation of some local morphometric properties, i.e., topographic thickness variation, of a three-dimensional object, such as a long bone shaft. Nonetheless, the use of morphometric maps is still limited in (paleo)anthropology, and their feasibility has not been adequately tested on fossil specimens. Using high-resolution microtomographic images, here we apply bi-dimensional virtual “unrolling” and synthetic thickness mapping techniques to compare cortical bone topographic variation across the shaft in a modern and a fossil human adult femur (the Magdalenian from Chancelade). We also test, for the first time, the possibility to virtually unroll and assess for dentine thickness variation in modern and fossil (the Neanderthal child from Roc de Marsal) human deciduous tooth roots. The analyses demonstrate the feasibility of using two-dimensional morphometric maps for the synthetic functional imaging and comparative biomechanical interpretation of cortical bone thickness variation in extant and fossil specimens and show the interest of using this technique also for the subtle characterization of root architecture and dentine topography. More specifically, our preliminary results support the use of virtual cartography as a tool for assessing to what extent internal root morphology is capable of responding to loading and directional stresses and strains in a predictable way.

  abstract = {MicroCT imaging is increasingly used in paleoanthropological and zooarchaeological research to analyse the internal microstructure of bone, replacing comparatively invasive and destructive methods. Consequently the analytical potential of this relatively new 3D imaging technology can be enhanced by developing discipline specific protocols for archaeological analysis. Here we examine how the microstructure of mammal bone changes after burning and explore if Xray computed microtomography (microCT) can be used to obtain reliable information from burned specimens. We subjected domestic pig, roe deer, and red fox bones to burning at different temperatures and for different periods using an oven and an open fire. We observed significant changes in the three-dimensional microstructure of trabecular bone, suggesting that biomechanical studies or other analyses (for instance, determination of age-at-death) can be compromised by burning. In addition, bone subjected to very high temperatures (600°C or more) became cracked, posing challenges for quantifying characteristics of bone microstructure. Specimens burned at 600°C or greater temperatures, exhibit a characteristic crisscross cracking pattern concentrated in the cortical region of the epiphyses. This feature, which can be readily observed on the surface of whole bone, could help the identification of heavily burned specimens that are small fragments, where color and surface texture are altered by diagenesis or weathering.},

The Hunters or the Hunted? is a very important book for paleoanthropology. It presents the first thorough analysis of the Sterkfontein Valley assemblages, contributes significantly to the resolution of lingering controversies and, by placing the old information in a fresh perspective, enables new and more sophisticated questions to be asked not only of the South African material but of similar assemblages elsewhere. Another contribution is that it reinforces the recent change in feelings as to what constitutes data, for the value of looking at fossil and contemporary bones as closely as this is clear. Brain urges the necessity of recovering fossils with a high regard for subtle detail. I hope excavators of any vertebrate fossil site will be persuaded to follow his advice and pay more attention to these features of bone accumulations that have been previously neglected; for taphonomy can be a powerful tool in elucidating the problems of fossil assemblages, especially when handled with the care and caution that Brain brings to the subject."—Andrew Hill, Nature},

Low levels of activity and mobility characterized the first 10 post-capture days. After this period, a gradual restoring of stable levels occurred. Wild boar captured by using different drug mixtures exhibited slightly different patterns of activity depression. We also showed capture to produce a partial effect on wild boar behavioural rhythmicity.

  abstract = {Vertebrate morphologists often implicate functional adaptations of bone to mechanical milieus when comparing animals with distinct behavioral repertoires. Functional morphologists frequently use comparative osteology and locomotor behavior to construct correlative form–function relationships. While some experimental work has investigated functional adaptations of bone elicited by specific locomotor behaviors, these studies usually manipulate repertoires by introducing artificial situations (e.g., treadmills) or creating differences in the level of activity (i.e., exercise), either of which can compromise extrapolations to free-ranging animals. Here, we present trabecular bone morphology and microarchitecture from an inbred mouse model in which components of naturalistic locomotor repertoires were accentuated. Using inbred mice, we control for genetic variability, further isolating the osteogenic responses to these behaviors. Single female (BALB/cByJ) mice (n = 10 per group) were housed for 8 weeks beginning at 30 days postbirth in custom-designed cages that accentuated either linear quadrupedalism or turning. Concurrently, mice in a control group were housed singly in open cages. The distal femoral metaphysis was scanned by micro-computed tomography at the end of the 8-week experiment protocol. The experimental groups, particularly the “linear” group, differed significantly from the control group (simulated “free-ranging” condition) in several variables: bone volume fraction (“linear” 42\% less than controls; “turning” 24\% less than controls), trabecular number (“linear” 12\% less than controls; “turning” 9\% less than controls), connectivity density (“linear” 43\% less than controls; “turning” 35\% less than controls), and a characterization of trabecular surfaces (“linear” 15\% greater than controls; “turning” 11\% greater than controls). No differences in the degree of anisotropy were observed among groups, and generally, “linear” and “turning” groups did not differ significantly from one another in any measures of trabecular microarchitecture. Considering the distinct differences in locomotor behaviors between the “linear” quadrupedalism and “turning” groups, these data suggest that comparisons at the distal femoral metaphysis of trabecular microarchitecture or orientation between different groups of animals may be somewhat limited in accurately reconstructing the loading conditions associated with different locomotor modes.},

Aging is a complex process, and the effects of aging are myriad and insidious, leading to progressive deterioration of various organs, including the skeleton. Age-related bone loss and resultant osteoporosis in the elderly population increase the risk for fractures and morbidity. Osteoporosis is one of the most common conditions associated with aging, and age is an independent risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. With the development of noninvasive imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), micro-CT, and high resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT), imaging of the bone architecture provides important information about age-related changes in bone microstructure and estimates of bone strength. In the past two decades, studies of human specimens using imaging techniques have revealed decreased bone strength in older adults compared with younger adults. The present paper addresses recently studied age-related changes in trabecular and cortical bone microstructure based primarily on HR-pQCT and micro-CT. We specifically focus on the three-dimensional microstructure of the vertebrae, femoral neck, and distal radius, which are common osteoporotic fracture sites.},

This expectation is pertinent to testing bone functional adaptation theories and to comparative studies, which commonly use skeletal remains that combine zoo and wild-caught specimens. Conservationists are also interested in the effects of captivity on bone morphology as it may influence rewilding success. We compared trabecular bone volume fraction (BVF) between wild and captive mountain lions, cheetahs, leopards and jaguars. We found significantly greater BVF in wild than in captive felids. Effects of captivity were more marked in the humerus than in the femur. A ratio of humeral/femoral BVF was also lower in captive animals and showed a positive relationship to home range size in wild animals. Results are consistent with greater forelimb than hindlimb loading during terrestrial travel, and possibly reduced loading of the forelimb associated with lack of predatory behaviour in captive animals. Thus, captivity among felids has general effects on BVF in the postcranial skeleton and location-specific effects related to limb use. Caution should be exercised when identifying skeletal specimens for use in comparative studies and when rearing animals for conservation purposes.},

  abstract = {The process of domestication is complex and results in significant morphological, cognitive, and physiological changes. In canids, some of the traits indicative of domestication of domestic dogs compared to their wild counterparts the wolves are prosociality toward humans, reduced stress hormone levels, and reduced cranial capacity. Research suggests that selection for prosociality among dogs resulted in morphological changes such as reduction in cranial capacity, juvenilization of the face, and overall gracile morphology. Interestingly, similar features have been described in modern humans compared to extinct species of Homo, for example, Neanderthals. Therefore, the human self-domestication hypothesis has been proposed to partially explain the gracile modern human skeleton. Specifically, that as modern humans settled in communities, there was increased selection for prosociality (intergroup cooperation); and one of the by-products of this selection was the evolution of a gracile skeleton, including a slight reduction in cranial capacity, reduced brow ridge and tooth size, and low trabecular bone fraction (TBF). However, TBF variation has not been tested between domestic dogs and wolves, who underwent self-domestication. Thus, this study tests the hypothesis that dogs have low TBF as a consequence of domestication compared to their wild counterparts, the wolves, by comparing TBF in the hindlimbs—proximal femur and distal tibia- of the two species. Wilcoxon rank sum tests show that dogs have lower TBF values than wolves in both elements. These preliminary results add to the literature documenting changes in self-domesticated species and provide a potential analog to further the understanding of self-domestication.},

  abstract = {The novel energetics of bipedalism affords humans the ability to walk and run for long distances; for instance, humans in traditional societies are known to walk up to 11km a day. Compared to their close relatives, humans appear unique in their ability to travel long distances, and it has been posited that this ability conferred human ancestors an advantage in exploiting large home ranges, tracking down prey, avoiding predation and scavenging for meat and marrow, and was related to changes in body shape in some members of early Homo. To better understand the anatomical adaptations that offered advantages to members of our genus, it is useful to employ comparative models of living mammals that bear adaptations for long distance travel and running. Cursorial mammals, in comparison to non-cursorial ones, display external structural adaptations that minimize mass, such as having thin, distally-tapering limbs to reduce the energetic costs of moving the distal limb; however, it is unclear how internal anatomical structures vary. Specifically, it is not clear how trabecular bone mass varies in related taxa with differing daily travel distances. It is plausible that taxa with long daily travel distances have adapted to greater energetic demands with decreased trabecular bone mass in limbs relative to those with short daily travel distances, as a means of minimizing energetic costs associated with moving and maintaining greater mass. To test this hypothesis, we measured trabecular bone mass (TBM) in fore- and hindlimb articulations of canids (Crocuta crocuta, Canis mesomelas, Lycaon pictus, Vulpes vulpes, Canis lupus), felids (Panthera onca, Panthera pardus, Acinonyx jubatus, Puma concolor), and cercopithecines (Chlorocebus aethiops, Erythrocebus patas, Theropithecus gelada, Papio anubis)—taxa underlined represent those with long daily travel distances ({$>$}10km/day). We accounted for body size differences by dividing TBM by body mass. TBM was measured using peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography scans taken through epiphyseal regions. The sample sizes per species ranged from N=5 to N=20. Our overall results show that, instead of minimizing mass as a way of reducing energetic expenditure, mammals with longer daily travel distances display higher TBM, which is consistent with observations of greater bone mass resulting from greater physical activity in experimental and exercise science studies. These results are not only consistent with the conventional understanding of bone functional adaptation, but also support the idea that recently documented variation in trabecular bone structure among hominins was not specifically related to a suite of adaptations for long-distance travel and running in early Homo, but were more influenced by changes in physical activity levels.

  abstract = {In Western Europe, the transition from the middle Iron Age to the early Roman period implied changes in livestock practices, with the emergence of a specialized and selective animal husbandry. These changes have been related in Italy and south of France with changes in livestock management involving their mobility between ecologically complementary areas. The study of this question in the Iberian Peninsula has only been partially investigated through palaeoenvironmental analyses, and the information about the origin and significance of this phenomenon is very scarce. To shed new light on this topic we used an archaeozoological approach, with the application of geometric morphometrics. They were used to study size and shape variability in sheep astragali from 9 sites dating from the middle Iron Age to the early Roman period (5th c. BC–3rd c. AD) and located on the Pyrenees and on the north-eastern Iberian coast as a case study. The results we obtained, combined with Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) and kill-off patterns, showed local specificities in terms of breeding methods and sheep morphologies between the two areas during the middle Iron Age. On the contrary, sheep with similar size and the implementation and development of similar sheep husbandry practices in the Pyrenees and the north-eastern Iberian coast were documented during the early Roman period. These results suggest the existence of livestock links between these two areas during the Roman period, that could be involved a possible movement of sheep between the lowlands and the Pyrenees for the first time.},

  abstract = {Identifying spatial and temporal variation in animal exploitation patterns is essential for building our understanding of the transition from hunting to stock-keeping. Quantitative analysis of the published records of over 400,000 animal bones recovered from 114 archaeological sites from SW Asia and SE Europe from c12~ka to c7.5~ka cal BP (thousands of calibrated radiocarbon years before present) demonstrates significant spatiotemporal variability in faunal exploitation patterns. Sites in the Euphrates region show adoption of domestic taxa by c10.5~ka cal BP, although on average these taxa contribute less than 10\% to total assemblage size. This rises to a median of about 40\% by c9.5~ka cal BP, and then to about 45\% of total NISP by c8.5~ka cal BP. By c10.5~ka in the Tigris and Zagros region domesticates contribute less than 5\% to faunal assemblages, but then rise to a median of about 20\% by c9.5~ka and 40\% by c8.4~ka cal BP. In contrast, Levantine sites have low numbers of domestic taxa ({$<$}1\%) until c8.8~ka cal BP, when the proportion dramatically increases to a median of about 35\%. This apparent delayed-adoption pattern also holds true for the southern Levant, which shows, on average, low levels ({$<$}1\%) of domestic taxa until 8.8~ka cal BP, at which point domesticates contribute a median of about 10\% to assemblages. In the northern parts of SW Asia, the mid- to late-10th millennium cal BP is pivotal, as proportions of domestic taxa show a dramatic increase in frequency during this time, and the ‘package’ of domestic sheep, goat, cattle and pig becomes more firmly established. This sets the trend for sites of the 9th millennium and the appearance of Neolithic communities in SE Europe from the 8th millennium cal BP onwards, from which point domestic animals are ubiquitous in faunal assemblages.},

  abstract = {Reduced mobility associated with captivity induces changes in biomechanical stress on the skeleton of domesticated animals. Due to bone plasticity, bone’s morphology and internal structure can respond to these new biomechanical stresses over individuals’ lifetime. In a context where documenting early process of animal domestication is challenging, this study will test the hypothesis that change in mobility patterns during a wild ungulate’s life will alter the internal structure of its limb bones and provide a proof of concept for the application of this knowledge in Zooarchaeology. Using the calcaneus as a phenotypic marker through qualitative and quantitative 3D microanatomical analyses, we relied on a comparative study across wild boars (Sus scrofa) populations from controlled experimental conditions with different mobility patterns (natural habitat, large pen, and stall) and archaeological specimens collected from middle and late Mesolithic as surrogate for the norm of reaction in European wild boar phenotype before the spread of agriculture and domestic pigs. Results provide evidence for compressive and tensile forces as the main elements affecting the variation in the cortical thickness along the calcaneus. Furthermore, changes in the internal structure of the calcaneus between mobility patterns are observed but their intensity is not directly associated with the degree of mobility restriction and only weakly impacted by the size or weight of the individuals. Despite having greater bone volume, the calcaneus of the Mesolithic wild boars displays a very similar microanatomy compared to the present-day hunted or captive wild boars. These results suggest that calcaneal microanatomy is more affected by population differences than by locomotor variation. For all these reasons, this preliminary study doesn’t support the use of microanatomy of the calcaneus as an indicator of change in locomotor behaviour induced by captivity in the archaeological record.},

  abstract = {Captive breeding programmes are increasingly relied upon for threatened species management. Changes in morphology can occur in captivity, often with unknown consequences for reintroductions. Few studies have examined the morphological changes that occur in captive animals compared with wild animals. Further, the effect of multiple generations being maintained in captivity, and the potential effects of captivity on sexual dimorphism remain poorly understood. We compared external and internal morphology of captive and wild animals using house mouse (Mus musculus) as a model species. In addition, we looked at morphology across two captive generations, and compared morphology between sexes. We found no statistically significant differences in external morphology, but after one generation in captivity there was evidence for a shift in the internal morphology of captive-reared mice; captive-reared mice (two generations bred) had lighter combined kidney and spleen masses compared with wild-caught mice. Sexual dimorphism was maintained in captivity. Our findings demonstrate that captive breeding can alter internal morphology. Given that these morphological changes may impact organismal functioning and viability following release, further investigation is warranted. If the morphological change is shown to be maladaptive, these changes would have significant implications for captive-source populations that are used for reintroduction, including reduced survivorship.},

  abstract = {The distribution of the first domesticated animals and crops along the coastal area of Atlantic NW Europe, which triggered the transition from a hunter-gatherer-fisher to a farmer-herder economy, has been debated for many decades among archaeologists. While some advocate a gradual transition in which indigenous hunter-gatherers from the very beginning of the 5th millennium cal BC progressively adopted Neolithic commodities, others are more in favor of a rapid transition near the end of the 5th millennium caused by a further northwest migration of farmers-herders colonizing the lowlands. Here, radiocarbon dated bones from sheep/goat and possibly also cattle are presented which provide the first hard evidence of an early introduction of domesticated animals within a hunter-gatherer context in NW Belgium, situated ca. 80~km north of the agro-pastoral frontier. Based on their isotope signal it is suggested that these first domesticates were probably not merely obtained through exchange with contemporaneous farmers but were kept locally, providing evidence of small-scale local stockbreeding in the lowlands maybe as early as ca. 4800/4600~cal BC. If confirmed by future in-depth isotope analyses, the latter testifies of intense contact and transmission of knowledge in this early contact period, which is also visible in the material culture, such as the lithic and pottery technology. It also implies direct and prolonged involvement of farmer-herders, either through visiting specialists or intermarriage, which follows recent genetic evidence demonstrating much more hunter-gatherer ancestry in early farmer’s genes in western Europe compared to central and SE Europe.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary biologists have recently solicited archaeologists to help document and understand the morphological evolution of animals in response to human activities and, more generally, to help reconstruct the history and significance of the anthropogenic impact on worldwide ecosystems. Artificial selection associated with domestication is the best-known example of a major anthropogenic morphological evolution preserved in the archaeological record. However, the impact of the domestication process and dispersal on the morphological evolution of animals has been far less explored. To fill this gap, we focused on 4500 years of evolution in Western Europe Sus scrofa, covering the Neolithic transition ? a major anthropogenic ecological disturbance involving landscape modification and the translocation of domestic mammals. Using geometric morphometrics on key phenotypic markers preserved in the archaeological record, associated with isotopic studies, we explored how, and in response to which cultural drivers, the Neolithic niche construction has influenced the morphological evolution of Western European wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa). The decoupling of size and shape components from bone morphological variation has facilitated the identification of several processes of phenotypic diversification of Sus s. scrofa in response to human behaviour during the Neolithic transition in Western Europe.},

  abstract = {Domestic animals have played an important role in shaping human Evolution and History. After millennia of constructing niches based on hunting, gathering, and foraging, a range of communities in diverse parts of the world embarked on trajectories of food production which in some instances led to the emergence of complex societies, urbanism, and empires, sowing the seeds for our current globalization. Thanks to intensive zooarcheology and genomics research, it is now common knowledge that, apart from dog domestication within hunter–gatherers societies around 23,000 years Before Present (BP) terminus post quem (Perri et al., 2021), the domestication of globally important livestock animals occurred within sedentary communities engaged in early agriculture in three independent cradles. The oldest of these is located in Southwest Asia where cereals (wheat, barley), legumes (pulse, peas, lentils), and fruits (figs) were domesticated between 12,000 and 10,000 BP, followed by sheep, goat, pigs, and cattle between 10,500 and 10,000 BP (Colledge et al., 2013). The second cradle is located in China where domesticated millets and rice were cultivated in the Yellow and Yangtze River valleys by 10,000 BP. This was followed relatively rapidly by pig domestication in the Yellow River valley (Jing and Flad, 2002; Cucchi et al., 2016). The last major center of ungulate domestication is located in the Andes, where agriculture based on imported maize and locally domesticated potato, beans, and squashes emerged between 9000 and 8000 BP along with South American camelids, llamas and alpacas, later followed by Barba’s duck and the guinea pig around 4000 BP (Pearsall, 2008; Hardigan et al., 2017). North America, also contributed to global animal domestication with the turkey by 2000 BP (Speller et al., 2010). In the Old World, a later series of animal domestications focused on the use of animal labor, with the domestic forms of donkey, horse, and camel emerging between 5000 and 2000 BP (Clutton-Brock, 2014). These animals revolutionized human economies and transportation, boosting the power of states, empires and the scale of warfare. Domestic animals have continued to emerge in recent times, including the rabbit in medieval Western Europe, rodents (including rats and hamsters) in the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as the fast-growing field of fish domestication in the 21st century.},

However, the geographic origin of the Cypriot boar and how they were integrated into the earliest forms of pig husbandry remain unsolved. Here, we present data on 11,000 to 9000~cal. BP               Sus scrofa               from the PPN sites of Klimonas and Shillourokambos. We compared them to contemporaneous populations from the Near East and to Neolithic and modern populations in Corsica, exploring their origin and evolution using biosystematic signals from molar teeth and heel bones (calcanei), using 2D and 3D geometric morphometrics. We found that the Cypriot PPN lineage of               Sus scrofa               originates from the Northern Levant. Yet, their phenotypic idiosyncrasy suggest that they evolved into an insular sub-species that we named               Sus scrofa circeus,               referring to Circe, the metamorphosis goddess that changed Ulysses companions into pigs. The phenotypic homogeneity among PPNA Klimonas wild boars and managed populations of PPNB Shillourokambos suggests that local domestication has been undertaken on the endemic               S               .               s. circeus               , strengthening the idea that Cyprus was integrated into the core region of animal domestication.},

  abstract = {Despite the almost ubiquitous presence of Holocene Sus remains in Island South East Asia (ISEA), the domestication of pigs and their dispersal in this region remains somewhat confused. Using molar shape geometric morphometric analysis, archaeological Sus dental series from the Sarawak caves of Niah (Aceramic, Neolithic) and Lobang Kudih (Ming period), are compared with extant ISEA wild pigs to establish their taxonomic status and to further explore the evidence for local domestication or introduction of allochthonous populations. Results on modern data-sets show that outline analysis of the third lower molar achieves highly significant inter- and intra-specific differentiation among ISEA wild pigs, with a phenotypic divergence structure displaying congruence with molecular phylogenies. Both tooth shape and mtDNA evidence strongly suggest the so-called wild pigs of New Guinea to be the descendants of pigs domesticated in mainland South East Asia and introduced by early farmers to ISEA. None of our data provide clear evidence for a Neolithic introduction of domesticated pigs, or for the local domestication of indigenous bearded pigs, since all Aceramic and Neolithic pigs from Niah cave have been identified as indigenous bearded pig (Sus barbatus). Local domestication experiments by foragers have not been ruled out, since evidence of hypoplasia as a marker of domestication processes has been observed. Introduction of allochthonous domestic pigs between the Late Neolithic and the Metal Age is suggested, since this small domestic breed from Lobang Kudih cave displays strong phenetic relationships with S. scrofa of New Guinea, recognised by molecular phylogeography as part of the ‘Pacific Clade’ linked both with Lapita and Polynesian dispersals. Introduction of celebensis-like species has also been suggested. Future studies should incorporate broader time-scale and geographical framework data-sets to strengthen these assumptions.

  abstract = {Pigs have played a major role in the economic, social and symbolic systems of China since the Early Neolithic more than 8,000 years ago. However, the interaction between the history of pig domestication and transformations in Chinese society since then, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigated the co-evolution from the earliest farming communities through to the new political and economic models of state-like societies, up to the Chinese Empire, using 5,000 years of archaeological records from the Xiawanggang (XWG) and Xinzhai (XZ) sites (Henan Province). To trace the changes of pig populations against husbandry practices, we combined the geometric morphometric analysis of dental traits with a study of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from bone collagen. The domestication process intensified during the Neolithic Yangshao, prompted by greater selective pressure and/or better herd control against wild introgression. After that, pig farming, in XWG, relied on local livestock and a gradual change of husbandry practices overtime. This was characterized by a gentle increase in millet foddering and animal protein intake, until a complete change over to household management during the Han dynasty. The only rupture in this steady trend of husbandry occurred during the Longshan period, with the appearance of small sized and idiosyncratic pigs with specific feeding practices (relying on millet and household scraps). From three exploratory hypothesis, we explored the possibility of anti-elite pig production in XWG during the Longshan period, as a means to resist incorporation into a new economic model promoting intensified domestic production. This exploratory hypothesis is the most suitable to our dataset; however, numerous areas need to be explored further in order to adequately document the role of pigs in the rise of China’s complex societies.},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on the biomechanical properties of bones. Bone is a physiologically dynamic tissue whose primary functions are to provide a mechanical support system for muscular activity, provide for the physical protection of organs and soft tissues, and act as a storage facility for systemic mineral homeostasis. The resulting structure of the skeleton is influenced heavily by mechanical principles, acting both as constraints and as driving forces in its architecture. The mechanical behavior of bone may be studied at two levels, material and structural. The material, or tissue, level properties of bone are evaluated by performing standardized mechanical tests on uniform bone tissue samples. They may also be estimated in vivo by using densitometric projections, but these are less accurate than actual mechanical testing. The assessment of bone mechanical properties can be made using techniques ranging from noninvasive imaging to in vitro mechanical tests of excised specimens or whole bones. Microcomputed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and peripheral qualitative CT (pQCT) methods of imaging, especially in use with finite element models, continue to improve in their accuracy of mechanical property assessment. The strength and rigidity of a bone are typically greater in the direction of customary loading, particularly in cortical bone, where osteons are oriented in a longitudinal direction as indicated by the bone's loading history. Cortical bone is stronger in compression than in tension, and after maturation the tensile strength and the modulus of elasticity of femoral cortical bone decline by approximately 2\% per decade. Another important mechanical property exhibited by bone is known as viscoelasticity, which is largely due to its water content, whereas material properties, such as strength and toughness, come from its solid-phase components.},

  abstract = {This study presents ecomorphological methods for reconstructing paleohabitats using three-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of Cervidae (deer and relatives) post-cranial elements. Cervids are often the most abundant taxon in Eurasian Plio-Pleistocene sites, yet their post-cranial remains are rarely utilized in paleoecological reconstructions. Cervids are found in a wide variety of habitats, and thus their ecomorphology spans an appropriate range to serve as a proxy for paleohabitat. Four morphological features are examined in this study; the calcaneus as a whole (n~=~122), the medial margin of the patellar surface of the femur (n~=~133), the lateral margin of the tibial plateau (n~=~136), and the plantar margin of the third phalanx (n~=~62). These features were chosen because they represent various aspects of cervid locomotion important for power generation, stability, and substrate interaction. For each feature, canonical variates analyses with cross-validations were used to assess how well landmark configurations distinguish among specimens from different habitat types. Cross-validations returned correct reclassifications rates ranging from 38.9\% to 66.3\% in a four-habitat system, with resubstitution rates of 55.4\% to 79.1\% correct. Most habitat groups were found to be significantly different at p~{$<~$}0.0001 using permutations tests. Variation in these ecomorphological adaptations are explored via visualizations depicting “open” and “closed” habitat types, and hypotheses are presented for cervid functional morphology.},

  abstract = {This is a comprehensive and accessible overview of what is known about the structure and mechanics of bone, bones, and teeth. In it, John Currey incorporates critical new concepts and findings from the two decades of research since the publication of his highly regarded The Mechanical Adaptations of Bones. Crucially, Currey shows how bone structure and bone's mechanical properties are intimately bound up with each other and how the mechanical properties of the material interact with the structure of whole bones to produce an adapted structure. For bone tissue, the book discusses stiffness, strength, viscoelasticity, fatigue, and fracture mechanics properties. For whole bones, subjects dealt with include buckling, the optimum hollowness of long bones, impact fracture, and properties of cancellous bone. The effects of mineralization on stiffness and toughness and the role of microcracking in the fracture process receive particular attention. As a zoologist, Currey views bone and bones as solutions to the design problems that vertebrates have faced during their evolution and throughout the book considers what bones have been adapted to do. He covers the full range of bones and bony tissues, as well as dentin and enamel, and uses both human and non-human examples. Copiously illustrated, engagingly written, and assuming little in the way of prior knowledge or mathematical background, Bones is both an ideal introduction to the field and also a reference sure to be frequently consulted by practicing researchers},

  abstract = {Studies in the past 20 years have often interpreted size fluctuations in fossil mammal remains as a response to climatic change, in accord with Bergmann's rule. However, such paleoecological inference requires careful consideration of changes in community composition that could cause ecological character displacement or release. Recent size gradients of mammals should be screened for the possibility of character displacement if fossil size gradients are to be used as a “paleothermometer” for past climate. The use of teeth in paleontological studies as a measure of body size presents a further complication; for several carnivore guilds, it appears that competitive pressures act most strongly on tooth size. Teeth may therefore inaccurately estimate body size, even if body size accurately indicates climatic conditions. In the fossil record different species exhibit different size patterns under the same conditions of climatic change, and the same species may show diametrically opposite size fluctuations under similar conditions of climatic change, in different regions.},

The results of the analyses of both charcoal and seeds show that the site was located on the top of a sand ridge covered by an upper riverbank forest with Quercus sp., Tilia sp., Ulmus sp. and Fraxinus excelsior, and surrounded by Alnus woodland. Seeds and fruits of Quercus sp., Cornus sanguinea, Corylus avellana, Malus sylvestris and Prunus spinosa probably represent food plants. High numbers of Viscum album charcoal fragments and Hedera helix seeds suggest the use of these plants as leaf fodder, and thus animal husbandry at the site. In terms of seasonality, the use of both Viscum album and Hedera helix is a strong indication that these wetland campsites were occupied during winter/early spring.},

This was undertaken using the combined approach of tooth outline and mitochondrial DNA analysis. The data provide clear evidence for three dispersal events: The first involved domesticated pigs, originating from wild Sus scrofa stock in mainland Southeast Asia, being introduced to the Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands, to the Mollucas, New Guinea, and Oceania. Archaeological specimens clearly link these pigs with the Lapita and subsequent Polynesian dispersals. Since the pigs on New Guinea are specifically linked with this dispersal, it follows that the current wild populations of the island must be the feral descendants of introduced domestic pigs from mainland Southeast Asia, which came into New Guinea via the Lesser Sunda Islands. A second dispersal event also involved domesticated pigs (this time from wild Sus scrofa populations from mainland East Asia), introduced to the Philippines and Micronesia, while a third involved the endemic warty pig of Sulawesi (Sus celebensis), which data from Liang Bua cave shows was introduced to Flores perhaps as early as 7000 B.C.},

Scaling of whole bone length and diameter has been extensively investigated, but scaling of the trabecular network is not well characterized. We analysed trabecular geometry in the femora of 90 terrestrial mammalian and avian species with body masses ranging from 3 g to 3400 kg. We found that bone volume fraction does not scale substantially with animal size, while trabeculae in larger animals' femora are thicker, further apart and fewer per unit volume than in smaller animals. Finite element modelling indicates that trabecular scaling does not alter the bulk stiffness of trabecular bone, but does alter strain within trabeculae under equal applied loads. Allometry of bone's trabecular tissue may contribute to the skeleton's ability to withstand load, without incurring the physiological or mechanical costs of increasing bone mass.},

  abstract = {Inner vertebral architecture is poorly known, except in human and laboratory animals. In order to document this topic at a broad comparative level, a 2D-histomorphometric study of vertebral centra was conducted in a sample of 98 therian mammal species, spanning most of the size range and representing the main locomotor adaptations known in therian taxa. Eleven variables relative to the development and geometry of trabecular networks were extracted from CT scan mid-sagittal sections. Phylogeny-informed statistical tests were used to reveal the respective influences of phylogeny, size, and locomotion adaptations on mammalian vertebral structure. The use of random taxon reshuffling and squared change parsimony reveals that 9 of the 11 characteristics (the two exceptions are total sectional area and structural polarization) contain a phylogenetic signal. Linear discriminant analyses suggest that the sampled taxa can be arranged into three categories with respect to locomotion mode: a) terrestrial + flying + digging + amphibious forms, b) coastal oscillatory aquatic taxa, and c) pelagic oscillatory aquatic forms represented by oceanic cetaceans. Pairwise comparison tests and linear regressions show that, when specific size increases, the length of trabecular network (Tt.Tb.Le), as well as trabecular proliferation in total sections (Pr.Tb.Tt), increase with positive allometry. This process occurs in all locomotion categories but is particularly pronounced in pelagic oscillators. Conversely, mean trabecular width has a lesser increase with size in pelagic oscillators. Trabecular orientation is not influenced by size. All tests were corrected for multiple testing. By using six structural variables or indices, locomotion mode can be predicted with a 97.4\% success rate for terrestrial forms, 66.7\% for coastal oscillatory, and 81.3\% for pelagic oscillatory. The possible functional meaning of these results and their potential use for paleobiological inference of locomotion in extinct taxa are discussed. J. Morphol., 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {With a few possible exceptions, the breeding systems of domestic pigs represented in mainland New Guinea fall into one of three categories. In the first, all pigs in the care of people are the progeny of matings between wild boars and wild sows, and the captive population is fully alienated from breeding. In the second, some pigs in the care of people are the progency of matings between wild boars and domestic sows, and the remainder are the progeny of wild boars and wild sows. The relative contributions of domestic and wild sows as mothers to the piglets that are taken into care vary among societies that implement this system of breeding pigs. In the third category, all pigs in the care of people are the progency of matings between domestic boards and domestic sows. Thus, in nearly all New Guinean domestic pig populations, the fathers of those pigs are either all wild boars or all domestic boars and, contrary to earlier conclusions, there is no continuum of pig-breeding systems within New Guinea. It is argued that the relatively high costs associated with managing domestic boars have inhibited transformation to full male and female breeding except in areas, such as highland New Guinea, where wild pigs are absent or rare. Further, the transformation to breeding systems of this type is likely to have been abrupt. Potential complications arising from inbreeding depression in small populations suggest that the circulation of live pigs among prehistoric New Guinean communities was a necessary precursor to the shift to full male and female breeding. Questions concerning the emergence of social complexity within the New Guinea highlands will need to be revisited in the light of this interpretation.},

Tepesi, a site which spans more than two millennia and has been considered as among the oldest domestication sites of the pig in Western Asia. The research included age at death estimations, osteometrical analysis of both dental and postcranial material, and the recording of a dental defect (Linear Enamel Hypoplasia or LEH). The analysis revealed a diachronic trend towards younger ages at death, smaller body size, shorter dentition andan increasing frequency of LEH. The results, however, cannot easily be interpreted within the simple dichotomy of "domestic "versus "wild" populations. Instead, they show gradual and slow changes and not sudden, dramatic events. This suggests a gradual intensification of the relationship between humans and Sus, a process that started early but developed only slowly. The data support the hypothesis that the Sus population at and around ?ay?n? lived in a relationship with humans, that was intermediary between "wild" and "domestic".

  abstract = {Limb long bones are essential to an animal's locomotion, and are thus expected to be heavily influenced by factors such as mass or habitat. Because they are often the only organs preserved in the fossil record, understanding their adaptive trends is key to reconstructing the paleobiology of fossil taxa. In this regard, the Bovidae has always been a prized group of study. This family is extremely diverse in terms of both mass and habitat, and it is expected that their bones will possess adaptations to both factors. Here, we present the first 3D geometric morphometric study focusing on bovid limb long bones. We used anatomical landmarks as well as curve and surface sliding semi-landmarks to accurately describe the stylopod and zeugopod bones. We included 50 species from ten of the twelve currently recognized tribes of bovids, ranging from 4.6 to 725 kg, and living in open plains, forests, mountains, or anywhere in-between. Shape data were correlated with the mean mass of the species and its habitat, even when taking into account the phylogenetic history of our sample. Bones pertaining to heavy species are more robust, adapted for a better repartition of stronger forces. Articulations are especially affected, being proportionally much larger in heavier species. Muscle insertion areas are unevenly affected. Insertion areas of muscles implied in body support and propulsion show a strong increase in their robustness when compared to insertion areas of muscles acting on the limb mostly when it is off the ground. Habitat influences the shape of the humerus, the radius-ulna, and the femur, but not of the tibia, whether the phylogeny is taken into account or not. Specific habitats tend to be associated with particular features on the bones. Articulations are proportionally wider in open-habitat species, and the insertion areas of muscles involved in limb extension and propulsion are wider, reflecting the fact that open habitat species are more cursorial and rely on fast running to avoid predators. Forest and mountain species generally present similar adaptations for increased manoeuvrability, such as a round femoral head, and generally have more gracile bones.},

  abstract = {Many tetrapod lineages show extreme increases in body mass in their evolutionary history, associated with important osteological changes. The ankle joint, essential for foot movement, is assumed to be particularly affected in this regard. We investigated the morphological adaptations of the astragalus and the calcaneus in Rhinocerotidae, and analysed them in light of a comparative analysis with other Perissodactyla. We performed 3D geometric morphometrics and correlated shape with centroid size of the bone and body mass of the species. Our results show that mass has an influence on bone shape in Rhinocerotidae and in Perissodactyla, but this is not as strong as expected. In heavy animals the astragalus has a flatter trochlea, orientated more proximally, associated with a more upright posture of the limb. The calcaneus is more robust, possibly to sustain the greater tension force exerted by the muscles during plantarflexion. Both bones show wider articular facets, providing greater cohesion and better dissipation of the loading forces. The body plan of the animals also has an influence. Short-legged Teleoceratina have a flatter astragalus than the other rhinocerotids. Paraceratherium has a thinner calcaneus than expected. This study clarifies adaptations to high body weight among Rhinocerotidae and calls for similar investigations in other groups with massive forms.},

  abstract = {Articular osteochondrosis (OC) often develops in typical locations within joints, and the characterization of OC distribution in the pig tarsus is incomplete. Prevalence of OC is high in domestic pigs but is presumed to be low in wild boars. Postmortem and computed tomography (CT) examinations of the talus and distal tibia from 40 domestic pigs and 39 wild boars were evaluated for the locations and frequencies of OC, synovial fossae, and other articular indentations, and frequency distribution maps were made. All domestic pigs but only 5 wild boars (13\%) had OC on the talus. In domestic pigs, OC consistently affected the axial aspect of the medial trochlea tali in 11 (28\%) joints and the distomedial talus in 26 (65\%) joints. In wild boars, all OC lesions consistently affected the distomedial talus. On the articular surface of the distal tibia, all domestic pigs and 34 wild boars (87\%) had synovial fossae and 7 domestic pigs (18\%) had superficial cartilage fibrillation opposite an OC lesion (kissing lesion). Other articular indentations occurred in the intertrochlear groove of the talus in all domestic pigs and 13 wild boars (33\%) and were less common on the trochlea tali. The prevalence of tarsal OC in wild boars is low. In domestic pigs and wild boars, OC is typically localized to the distomedial talus and in domestic pigs also to the medial trochlea tali. Further investigations into the reasons for the low OC prevalence in wild boars may help in developing strategies to reduce OC incidence in domestic pigs.},

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) – maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics – in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93\% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains.},

Although modern genetics are significantly improving our understanding of domestication and breed formation, little is still known about the associated morphological changes linked to the process itself.

The shape of the inner ear, part of the mammalian ear, has been found particularly relevant for discriminating domesticated species, their hybrids or differentiating the wild and domestic populations of a single species. Here we assessed the use of the size and shape of the semicircular canals (SCC) of the inner ear as a marker of pig domestication. We studied a total of 63 petrosal bones belonging to wild boar (Sus scrofa, two populations) and domestic pigs (extensively and intensively reared specimens) that were µCT-scanned and from which the size and the shape of the inner ear were quantified through geometric morphometrics, analyzing the 3D coordinates of 6 landmarks and 60 sliding semilandmarks localized on the SCC and the common crus. The domestic pigs have larger SCC than the wild boar from which they also strongly differ in shape (correct cross validation of 95.5\%, confidence interval: 92.3\%–98.1\%). Strong shape differences were detected between the two populations of wild boar, as well as a sexual size dimorphism. All together the results highlight the taxonomic discriminant power of the SCC of the inner ear shape, and its relevance for domestication studies.},

Recent ancient DNA (aDNA) research also indicates the incorporation of European wild boar into domestic stock during the Neolithization process. In order to establish the timing of the arrival of domestic pigs into Europe, and to test hypotheses regarding the role European wild boar played in the domestication process, we combined a geometric morphometric analysis (allowing us to combine tooth size and shape) of 449 Romanian ancient teeth with aDNA analysis. Our results firstly substantiate claims that the first domestic pigs in Romania possessed the same mtDNA signatures found in Neolithic pigs in west and central Anatolia. Second, we identified a significant proportion of individuals with large molars whose tooth shape matched that of archaeological (likely) domestic pigs. These large ‘domestic shape’ specimens were present from the outset of the Romanian Neolithic (6100–5500 cal BC) through to later prehistory, suggesting a long history of admixture between introduced domestic pigs and local wild boar. Finally, we confirmed a turnover in mitochondrial lineages found in domestic pigs, possibly coincident with human migration into Anatolia and the Levant that occurred in later prehistory.},

  abstract = {Researchers strive to understand what makes species different, and what allows them to survive in the time and space that they do. Many models have been advanced which encompass an array of ecological, evolutionary, mathematical, and logical principles. The goal has been to develop ecological theories that can, among other things, make specific and robust predictions about how and where organisms should live and what organisms should utilize. The role of functional morphology is often an under-appreciated parameter of these models. A more complete understanding of how anatomical features work to allow the organism to accomplish certain tasks has allowed us to revisit some of these ideas with a new perspective. We illustrate our view of this role for functional morphology in ecology by considering the issue of specialization: we attempt to align several definitions of specialization based upon shared ecological and evolutionary principles, and we summarize theoretical predictions regarding why an organism might specialize. Kinematic studies of prey capture in several types of fishes are explored with regard to the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of specialization, most notably in the area of trade-offs. We suggest that a functional morphological perspective can increase our understanding of the ecological concepts of specialization and it consequences. The kinds of data that functional morphologists collect can help us to quantify organismal performance associated with specialization and the union of functional morphology with ecology can help us to better understand not just how but why organisms interact in the manner that they do.},

  abstract = {Archaeological evidence indicates that pig domestication had begun by ?10,500 y before the present (BP) in the Near East, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) suggests that pigs arrived in Europe alongside farmers ?8,500 y BP. A few thousand years after the introduction of Near Eastern pigs into Europe, however, their characteristic mtDNA signature disappeared and was replaced by haplotypes associated with European wild boars. This turnover could be accounted for by substantial gene flow from local European wild boars, although it is also possible that European wild boars were domesticated independently without any genetic contribution from the Near East. To test these hypotheses, we obtained mtDNA sequences from 2,099 modern and ancient pig samples and 63 nuclear ancient genomes from Near Eastern and European pigs. Our analyses revealed that European domestic pigs dating from 7,100 to 6,000 y BP possessed both Near Eastern and European nuclear ancestry, while later pigs possessed no more than 4\% Near Eastern ancestry, indicating that gene flow from European wild boars resulted in a near-complete disappearance of Near East ancestry. In addition, we demonstrate that a variant at a locus encoding black coat color likely originated in the Near East and persisted in European pigs. Altogether, our results indicate that while pigs were not independently domesticated in Europe, the vast majority of human-mediated selection over the past 5,000 y focused on the genomic fraction derived from the European wild boars, and not on the fraction that was selected by early Neolithic farmers over the first 2,500 y of the domestication process.},

Their success is evident in the multitude of habitats in which they are found as both natural and feral populations in tropical Island Southeast Asia, the high plateau of the Himalayas, Siberia, North Africa, the Pacific Islands, Australia, and the Americas. Morphological and molecular analyses of these species have revealed numerous aspects of their biology, including the ease with which many lineages have and continue to hybridize. This trait has made them an ideal model for evolutionary biologists. Suid species have also shared a deep history with humans, from their association with early hominids in Africa to their domestication. Here we review the current knowledge of this fascinating group and provide a comprehensive evolutionary history from the Oligocene to the present day.},

Periosteal bone joins the endochondral centre below and, in well-differentiated specimens also above. The basal periosteal collar forms the surfaces of the sinus and canalis tarsi, whereas the cranial bony collar is included in the tibiotalar joint.

  abstract = {The Wild Boar Sus scrofa L. is widely distributed in Europe, Asia and North-West Africa. It has also been introduced into the USA and Argentina. Authors have described 22 subspecies on the basis of cranium shape and size. Differences in taxonomic characters have been evaluated using one-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons have been performed with the Bonferroni Test. Cranium shape does not allow reliable statistical distinction, and is not valid as a diagnostic tool. Cranium profile-which only differs for the male specimens, with populations differing at a value of 26.9\%, or at the subspecies level 24.4\%–cannot be used as a diagnostic tool. The length, width and their proportions of the third upper molar tooth show the following differences between subspecies: 39.1\%, 41.0\% and 8.3\% for males and 36.1\%, 41.7\% and 16.7\% for females, respectively. Only the first two criteria are useful as diagnostic tools. The percentage distance between the palatum durum and the basipterygoideus suture, the length of the third lower molar tooth and proportion between the height of lacrimal bone at the orbit and its lower suture length differ as follows: at the subspecies level 46.7\%, 38.5\% and 56.4\% for the male specimens and 36.1\%, 45.8\% and 55.6\% for the female ones. All of these characters can be used as diagnostic criteria. Taking these taxonomic characters and the four shapes of the lacrimal bone together with the rear margin of palatum durum as a basis, only four subspecies of Wild Boar are recognizable: Sus scrofa scrofa, inhabiting North-West Africa, Europe and West Asia; Sus scrofa ussuricus, which inhabits North Asia and Japan; Sus scrofa cristatus, which inhabits the Asia Minor peninsula, India and the Far-East; and Sus scrofa vittatus, which inhabits Indonesia.},

  abstract = {Background: In addition to external bone shape and cortical bone thickness and distribution, the distribution and orientation of internal trabecular bone across individuals and species has yielded important functional information on how bone adapts in response to load. In particular, trabecular bone analysis has played a key role in studies of human and nonhuman primate locomotion and has shown that species with different locomotor repertoires display distinct trabecular architecture in various regions of the skeleton. In this study, we analyse trabecular structure throughout the distal femur of extant hominoids and test for differences due to locomotor loading regime. Methods: Micro-computed tomography scans of Homo sapiens (n = 11), Pan troglodytes (n = 18), Gorilla gorilla (n = 14) and Pongo sp. (n = 7) were used to investigate trabecular structure throughout the distal epiphysis of the femur. We predicted that bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in the medial and lateral condyles in Homo would be distally concentrated and more anisotropic due to a habitual extended knee posture at the point of peak ground reaction force during bipedal locomotion, whereas great apes would show more posteriorly concentrated BV/TV and greater isotropy due to a flexed knee posture and more variable hindlimb use during locomotion. Results: Results indicate some significant differences between taxa, with the most prominent being higher BV/TV in the posterosuperior region of the condyles in Pan and higher BV/TV and anisotropy in the posteroinferior region in Homo. Furthermore, trabecular number, spacing and thickness differ significantly, mainly separating Gorilla from the other apes. Discussion: The trabecular architecture of the distal femur holds a functional signal linked to habitual behaviour; however, there was more similarity across taxa and greater intraspecific variability than expected. Specifically, there was a large degree of overlap in trabecular structure across the sample, and Homo was not as distinct as predicted. Nonetheless, this study offers a comparative sample of trabecular structure in the hominoid distal femur and can contribute to future studies of locomotion in extinct taxa.},

Les quatre gisements principaux consid?r?s sont attribuables au Premier M?solithique (X?me- VIIe mill?naire av. notre ?re) et sont tous situ?s dans le Nord de la France et en Belgique. L'analyse des collections lithiques a permis de mettre en ?vidence un outillage brut tr?s important qui constitue la majorit? des objets utilis?s par les pr?historiques. Ce r?sultat am?ne ? r? interroger les acquis des ?tudes qui ne raisonnaient que sur les pi?ces retouch?es volontairement. Les 501 zones utilis?es reconnues montrent logiquement que les M?solithiques ont transform? des mati?res animales, en particulier la peau. L'artisanat v?g?tal apparait lui aussi tr?s bien repr?sent?, ce qui constitue un vrai changement par rapport au Pal?olithique. Le raclage des plantes et du bois ?tait probablement une activit? majeure pendant toute la p?riode m?solithique. Des contrastes peuvent ?tre observ?s entre les gisements, probablement en raison de fonctions de site diff?rentes. Il est certain que cette variabilit? est aussi li?e ? des facteurs chrono-culturels qui pourront ? l'avenir ?tre mieux compris gr?ce ? une approche int?gr?e comme celle qui a ?t? d?velopp?e dans cette th?se.},

  abstract = {Urbanization is considered as one of the most important land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes with multiple pervasive effects on biodiversity. However, the quantitative assessment of biodiversity responses to urbanization remains challenging because some species can be directly and negatively affected by the spread of human settlements, while others can benefit from this LULC change. Moreover, although species sensitivity to urban settlements (their “synanthropy”) can either correspond to the spatial segregation of individuals within urban habitats or to their positive temporal trends in these habitats, these two facets are hardly distinguished explicitly. Here, we confronted the fine-scale spatial distribution of all the buildings in France with the spatial distribution and population trends of the 119 most common French breeding birds monitored in 2124 plots from 2001 to 2012. We developed and tested two indicators of “synanthropy”. The first indicator (S1) differentiates species along a continuous gradient from urban “avoiders” (low S1) to urban “dwellers” (high S1). The second indicator measures the beneficial or detrimental effect of building densities on the temporal trends of the populations. It allows the segregation among urban “losers” having lower temporal trends with increasing buildings (low S2) from urban “winners” (high S2) having more positive trends in more urbanized areas. We then tested the relationships between S1 and S2 with a set of species and life history traits. Finally, we transposed these species indicators to communities using community weighted means to test the link between the synanthropy of communities with bird species richness, and the spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal trends of the synanthropy of bird communities. We found that 43\% of the species were “urban dwellers”, and 18\% “urban winners”. Both urban dwellers and winners were species widely distributed and locally abundant. Urban dwellers were mainly ground feeders but did not nest on the ground. At the community level, high species richness was associated with medium-values of community synanthropy, following the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis. We found that the average value of community synanthropy and their trend were not randomly distributed in space. These two indicators of synanthropy can be used in different taxonomic groups and areas to assess the proportion of synanthropic species within communities, to monitor their temporal trends and their spatial distribution and represent a straightforward complement to the synthetic indicators of human footprint on biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The adaptive growth response of cartilage, or chondral modeling, can result in changes in joint and limb proportions during ontogeny and ultimately contribute to the adult form. Despite Hamrick's (1999) reevaluation of the mechanisms of chondral modeling, the process of chondral modeling remains poorly studied in animal models. Here, we characterize the macro- and microanatomical responses of the femoral growth plate, articular cartilage, and bone in 15 juvenile Sus scrofa domestica subjected to different locomotor activity patterns. The exercised animals exhibit thinner cartilage zones, greater cellularity and larger proliferative chondrocyte areas in the growth plate, as well as larger femoral dimensions and a more elongate femoral head compared with sedentary controls. In general, the growth plate demonstrates greater adaptive changes than articular cartilage. Moreover, chondrocyte hypertrophy and proliferation were found to be responsive to locomotor loading and thus more important factors in chondral modeling than the extracellular matrix variables that were examined herein. In sum, the underlying mechanisms of adaptive chondrogenesis and bone plasticity are key to informing evolutionary and translational studies regarding determinants of variation in joint form and function. Given the disparity between the predictions of chondral modeling theory and our experimental findings, this suggests a need for further evaluation of chondral modeling responses during ontogeny.

  abstract = {Organisms are organized into suites of anatomical structures that typically covary when developmentally or functionally related, and this morphological integration plays a determinant role in evolutionary processes. Artificial selection on domestic species causes strong morphological changes over short time spans, frequently resulting in a wide and exaggerated phenotypic diversity. This raises the question of whether integration constrains the morphological diversification of domestic species and how natural and artificial selection may impact integration patterns. Here, we study the morphological integration in the appendicular skeleton of domestic horses and donkeys, using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics on 75 skeletons. Our results indicate that a strong integration is inherited from developmental mechanisms which interact with functional factors. This strong integration reveals a specialization in the locomotion of domestic equids, partly for running abilities. We show that the integration is stronger in horses than in donkeys, probably because of a greater degree of specialization and predictability of their locomotion. Thus, the constraints imposed by integration are weak enough to allow important morphological changes and the phenotypic diversification of domestic species.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The lack of bone morphological markers associated with the human control of wild animals has prevented the documentation of incipient animal domestication in archaeology. Here, we assess whether direct environmental changes (i.e. mobility reduction) could immediately affect ontogenetic changes in long bone structure, providing a skeletal marker of early domestication. We relied on a wild boar experimental model, analysing 24 wild-born specimens raised in captivity from 6~months to 2~years old. The shaft cortical thickness of their humerus was measured using a 3D morphometric mapping approach and compared with 23 free-ranging wild boars and 22 pigs from different breeds, taking into account sex, mass and muscle force differences. In wild boars we found that captivity induced an increase in cortical bone volume and muscle force, and a topographic change of cortical thickness associated with muscular expression along a phenotypic trajectory that differed from the divergence induced by selective breeding. These results provide an experimental proof of concept that changes in locomotor behaviour and selective breeding might be inferred from long bones morphology in the fossil and archaeological record. These trends need to be explored in the archaeological record and further studies are required to explore the developmental changes behind these plastic responses.},

We hypothesized that changes in locomotor behaviour in a wild ungulate due to mobility control could be quantified in the bone anatomy. To test this, we experimented with the effect of mobility reduction on the skeleton of wild boar (               Sus scrofa               ), using the calcaneus shape as a possible phenotypic marker. We first assessed differences in shape variation and covariation in captive-reared and wild-caught wild boars, taking into account differences in sex, body mass, available space for movement and muscle force. This plastic signal was then contrasted with the phenotypic changes induced by selective breeding in domestic pigs. We found that mobility reduction induces a plastic response beyond the shape variation of wild boars in their natural habitat, associated with a reduction in the range of locomotor behaviours and muscle loads. This plastic signal of captivity in the calcaneus shape differs from the main changes induced by selective breeding for larger muscle and earlier development that impacted the pigs' calcaneus shape in a much greater extent than the mobility reduction during the domestication process of their wild ancestors.},

  abstract = {Many captive animals are fed diets that are drastically different in mechanical properties than their wild diet. Most captive pantherines are fed a nutritionally supplemented diet consisting almost entirely of ground meat. While many zoos supplement this diet with bones, the fact remains that large captive felids are fed diets that require substantially less masticatory effort than those of their wild counterparts. The osteological effects of this dietary difference have not been fully evaluated. To this end, we compared linear measurements and 3D geometric morphometric landmarks of captive and wild lions and tigers. Using Principal Component (PC) analysis of the linear measurements, not only were the sexes and species statistically distinct, but so too was the population clearly divisible in terms of captivity status. The 3D analysis supported these findings: although the most influential variable in the sample (PC1, 21.5\% of the variation) separates the two species, the second most influential contributor (PC2) to the overall skull shape is driven not by the sex differences in these highly dimorphic species, but rather by their captivity status. In fact, captivity status drives nearly twice as much of the 3D variation as sexual dimorphism (14.8\% vs. 8.0\% for PC2 vs. PC3). Thus the shape is influenced nearly twice as much by whether the animal was captive or wild than by whether it was male or female. If a causal relationship can be demonstrated between dietary mechanical properties and morphology, people who oversee the diets of captive carnivores should consider modifying these diets to account for not only nutritional but also the mechanical properties of a carcass-based diet as well. In addition to the husbandry implications, our analyses show the ways in which captive specimens are different than their wild counterparts – findings that have implications for morphologists when considering anatomical samples.},

  abstract = {Geometric morphometric methods (GMM), which were developed to characterize the shape and size of biological organisms, have been applied within zooarchaeology over the past decade to address animal domestication processes and to refine morphological criteria to differentiate between taxa. However, there has been limited utilization of these methods to discriminate between populations of the same taxa to challenge and refine other key archaeological issues, such as migration and connectivity in prehistory. Presented here is a novel application of a three-dimensional landmark based geometric morphometric approach to address the nature of long distance trade and connectivity on the prehistoric Silk Road. The similarity of Bronze and Iron Age archaeological cultures along this steppe route has encouraged characterisations of these people as nomads, with highly mobile, integrated, and connected human and animal populations. However, the interconnectedness of domestic animal populations, in particular sheep (Ovis aries), the foundation of this prehistoric pastoral economy, has never been examined. This study utilized geometric morphometric methods to quantify geometric morphometric variance of O. aries astragali between three geographically disparate settlement sites within a single Final Bronze age cultural and chronological context. Significant differences between morphotypes revealed that protracted mobility patterns were unlikely and that while animal exchange may have occurred, it was not pervasive enough to produce a uniform sheep morphotype across central and southeastern Kazakhstan. The result of this new application of geometric morphometric methods challenges models of uniform and undifferentiated long distance mobility and economic connectivity between the peoples of the Silk Road.},

  abstract = {Observations that dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures of areal bone mineral density cannot completely explain fracture incidence after anti-resorptive treatment have led to renewed interest in bone quality. Bone quality is a vague term but generally refers to the effects of skeletal factors that contribute to bone strength but are not accounted for by measures of bone mass. Because a clinical fracture is ultimately a mechanical event, it follows then that any clinically relevant modification of bone quality must change bone biomechanical performance relative to bone mass. In this perspective, we discuss a framework for assessing the clinically relevant effects of bone quality based on two general concepts: (1) the biomechanical effects of bone quality can be quantified from analysis of the relationship between bone mechanical performance and bone density; and (2) because of its hierarchical nature, biomechanical testing of bone at different physical scales ({$<$}1~mm, 1~mm, 1~cm, etc.) can be used to isolate the scale at which the most clinically relevant changes in bone quality occur. As an example, we review data regarding the relationship between the strength and density in excised specimens of trabecular bone and highlight the fact that it is not yet clear how this relationship changes during aging, osteoporosis development, and anti-resorptive treatment. Further study of new and existing data using this framework should provide insight into the role of bone quality in osteoporotic fracture risk.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: This review brings together a complex and extensive literature to address the question of whether it is possible to distinguish human from nonhuman bone using the histological appearance of cortical bone. The mammalian species included are rat, hare, badger, racoon dog, cat, dog, pig, cow, goat, sheep, deer, horse, water buffalo, bear, nonhuman primates, and human and are therefore not exhaustive, but cover those mammals that may contribute to a North American or Eurasian forensic assemblage. The review has demonstrated that differentiation of human from certain nonhuman species is possible, including small mammals exhibiting Haversian bone tissue and large mammals exhibiting plexiform bone tissue. Pig, cow, goat, sheep, horse, and water buffalo exhibit both plexiform and Haversian bone tissue and where only Haversian bone tissue exists in bone fragments, differentiation of these species from humans is not possible. Other primate Haversian bone tissue is also not distinguishable from humans. Where differentiation using Haversian bone tissue is undertaken, both the general microstructural appearance and measurements of histological structures should be applied. Haversian system diameter and Haversian canal diameter are the most optimal and diagnostic measurements to use. Haversian system density may be usefully applied to provide an upper and lower limit for humans.},

  abstract = {Long bone inner structure and cross-sectional geometry display a strong functional signal, leading to convergences, and are widely analyzed in comparative anatomy at small and large taxonomic scales. Long bone microanatomical studies have essentially been conducted on transverse sections but also on a few longitudinal ones. Recent studies highlighted the interest in analyzing variations of the inner structure along the diaphysis using a qualitative as well as a quantitative approach. With the development of microtomography, it has become possible to study three-dimensional (3D) bone microanatomy and, in more detail, the form–function relationships of these features. This study focused on the selection of quantitative parameters to describe in detail the cross-sectional shape changes and distribution of the osseous tissue along the diaphysis. Two-dimensional (2D) virtual transverse sections were also performed in the two usual reference planes and results were compared with those obtained based on the whole diaphysis analysis. The sample consisted in 14 humeri and 14 femora of various mammalian taxa that are essentially terrestrial. Comparative quantitative analyses between different datasets made it possible to highlight the parameters that are strongly impacted by size and phylogeny and the redundant ones, and thus to estimate their relevance for use in form-function analyses. The analysis illustrated that results based on 2D transverse sections are similar for both sectional planes; thus if a strong bias exists when mixing sections from the two reference planes in the same analysis, it would not problematic to use either one plane or the other in comparative studies. However, this may no longer hold for taxa showing a much stronger variation in bone microstructure along the diaphysis. Finally, the analysis demonstrated the significant contribution of the parameters describing variations along the diaphysis, and thus the interest in performing 3D analyses; this should be even more fruitful for heterogeneous diaphyses. In addition, covariation analyses showed that there is a strong interest in removing the size effect to access the differences in the microstructure of the humerus and femur. This methodological study provides a reference for future quantitative analyses on long bone inner structure and should make it possible, through a detailed knowledge of each descriptive parameter, to better interpret results from the multivariate analyses associated with these studies. This will have direct implications for studies in vertebrate anatomy, but also in paleontology and anthropology.},

It demonstrates the great diversity of amniote vertebral microanatomy and highlights that it reflects structural, phylogenetic and ecological signals. Various microanatomical parameters appear to be strongly correlated with overall body size, which seems to be the principal structural constraint. A phylogenetic signal was detected but appears rather low. This study also reveals the peculiarity of squamates among amniotes, and notably of squamate fossorial taxa that show clearly distinct trends from those of the other fossorial amniotes, probably as they essentially use movements of the vertebral column rather than the legs to dig. Analyses based on habitat reveal several trends and two main tendencies concerning the tightness of the spongiosa (squamates excluded): a low number of relatively thick trabeculae in arboreal, flying and fossorial taxa, versus a high number of relatively thin trabeculae in aquatic forms. It also suggests that comparisons based on functional requirements, rather than habitat, would be more relevant.},

  abstract = {The patella is the largest sesamoid bone of the skeleton. It is strongly involved in the knee, improving output force and velocity of the knee extensors, and thus plays a major role in locomotion and limb stability. However, the relationships between its structure and functional constraints, that would enable a better understanding of limb bone functional adaptations, are poorly known. This contribution proposes a comparative analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, of the microanatomy of the whole patella in perissodactyls, which show a wide range of morphologies, masses, and locomotor abilities, in order to investigate how the microanatomy of the patella adapts to evolutionary constraints. The inner structure of the patella consists of a spongiosa surrounded by a compact cortex. Contrary to our expectations, there is no increase in compactness with bone size, and thus body size and weight, but only an increase in the tightness of the spongiosa. No particular thickening of the cortex associated with muscle insertions is noticed but a strong thickening is observed anteriorly at about mid-length, where the strong intermediate patellar ligament inserts. The trabeculae are mainly oriented perpendicularly to the posterior articular surface, which highlights that the main stress is anteroposteriorly directed, maintaining the patella against the femoral trochlea. Conversely, anteriorly, trabeculae are rather circumferentially oriented, following the insertion of the patellar ligament and, possibly also, of the quadriceps tendon. A strong variation is observed among perissodactyl families but also intraspecifically, which is in accordance with previous studies suggesting a higher variability in sesamoid bones. Clear trends are nevertheless observed between the three families. Equids have a much thinner cortex than ceratomorphs. Rhinos and equids, both characterized by a development of the medial border, show an increase in trabecular density laterally suggesting stronger stresses laterally. The inner structure in tapirs is more homogeneous despite the absence of medial development of the medial border with no “compensation” of the inner structure, which suggests different stresses on their knees associated with a different morphology of their patellofemoral joint.},

Early forms of the species were larger than Late Pleistocene ones, but neither the chronology nor the causes of the size reduction have been thoroughly investigated. Here, we considered for the first time a large number of fossils from several late Middle Pleistocene to Early Holocene sites of the Apulian region (Italian Peninsula). In contrast to the supposed existence of a progressive trend towards small dimensions, morphometric comparisons and body mass estimates allow us to recognize several size oscillations during the late Middle Pleistocene-Early Holocene, with large forms occurring during interglacial stages and smaller ones during glacial stages. This suggests that fossil Apulian wild boar did not conform to Bergmann’s rule, that predicts larger size in colder climates due to the selective pressure towards lower surface area to volume ratio. Climate recrudescence may have played an indirect role in reducing the availability of trophic resources and hence promoting the observed pattern.},

  abstract = {Prehistoric man-animal relationships can be studied from both a zoological and an archaeological viewpoint. Despite the considerable degree of overlap between the approaches the interests of the two disciplines are substantially different. It is important that archaeology should develop hypotheses concerned primarily with human behaviour. Animal husbandry can be viewed as a group of close relationships between man and animals, in which man derives benefit from a dependable and efficient exploitation. Such relationships are not necessarily confined either to the modern farmyard domesticates or to the Holocene period. It is to be expected that the exploitation of species which provided food staples was regulated so as to favour the success of both species involved in the relationship. Reindeer, red deer, fallow deer, and gazelle were successfully exploited for long periods, in certain cases many millennia. The data at some sites suggest that individual human groups may have been dependent upon particular herds or populations of animals on a year-round basis. The slaughter patterns, where they are known, show a selective pattern of exploitation as opposed to a random kill. These Pleistocene economies illustrate the difficulty of accommodating archaeological data successfully to the zoological wild/domestic classification. A more appropriate classification for archaeological purposes will be concerned with variations in human behaviour rather than in animal morphology. Such a classification may as usefully indicate the continuities in human and animal behaviour, as concentrate exclusively on a single dramatic change.},

  abstract = {Background and Aim: Captivity alters the locomotor behavior of wild artiodactyls and affects the mechanical loading of the calcaneus; however, the resulting adaptive changes in calcaneus morphology have not been sufficiently studied to date. This study aimed to investigate the morphological and mechanical adaptive variations in the calcaneus of Saiga tatarica to understand further the functional adaptation of the calcaneus in wild artiodactyl to captivity. Materials and Methods: Paired calcanei from autopsy samples of six captive wild artiodactyls (S. tatarica) and six domesticated artiodactyls (Ovis aries) were divided into skeletally immature and mature groups using X-ray evaluation of growth plate closure. High-resolution microcomputed tomography revealed a calcaneal diaphyseal cross-section. The mechanical and nanomorphological characteristics of the trabecular bone were determined by atomic force microscopy. Results: The percent cortical bone area (\%CA), cortical thickness ratio (CTR), and Young’s modulus (E) differed between species in the immature groups but not in the mature groups. S. tatarica had significantly higher growth rates for \%CA, CTR, and E in the mid-shaft than O. aries (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: The calcaneus morphology of S. tatarica converges with that of domesticated O. aries during ontogeny. These results indicate that the calcaneus of wild artiodactyls can undergo potentially transitional changes during the short-term adaptation to captivity. The above parameters can be preliminarily identified as morphological signs of functional bone adaptation in artiodactyls.},

It remains less well known how different locomotor habits are correlated with cross-sectional traits of the limb skeleton, such as cross-sectional area (CSA), second moments of area (SMA), and section modulus (MOD) and whether these traits have evolved adaptively. CSA and SMA represent the bone’s resistance to axial compression and bending, respectively, whereas MOD represents bone structural strength related to shape. Sampling 28 species of mustelids, a carnivoran lineage with diverse locomotor habits, we tested for differences in humeral, radial, and ulnar cross-sectional traits among specialists for climbing, digging, and swimming, in addition to generalists. Given that the limbs of digging specialists function in the dense substance of soil, and that swimming specialists need to counteract buoyancy, we predicted that these mustelids with these specializations should have the greatest values of cross-sectional traits.},

Analyses of trabecular bone have been commonplace for several decades in a human clinical context. In contrast, the study of trabecular bone as a method for reconstructing joint position, joint loading and ultimately behaviour in extant and fossil non-human primates is comparatively new. Since the initial 2D studies in the late 1970s and 3D analyses in the 1990s, the utility of trabecular bone to reconstruct behaviour in primates has grown to incorporate experimental studies, expanded taxonomic samples and skeletal elements, and improved methodologies. However, this work, in conjunction with research on humans and non-primate mammals, has also revealed the substantial complexity inherent in making functional inferences from variation in trabecular architecture. This review addresses the current understanding of trabecular bone functional adaptation, how it has been applied to hominoids, as well as other primates and, ultimately, how this can be used to better interpret fossil hominoid and hominin morphology. Because the fossil record constrains us to interpreting function largely from bony morphology alone, and typically from isolated bones, analyses of trabecular structure, ideally in conjunction with that of cortical structure and external morphology, can offer the best resource for reconstructing behaviour in the past.},

Modules are sets of traits that are internally integrated by interactions among traits, but are relatively independent from other modules. The interactions within modules rely on different mechanisms, depending on the context of a study. For morphological traits, modularity occurs in developmental, genetic, functional, and evolutionary contexts. A range of methods for quantifying integration and modularity in morphological data is available, and a number of comparative and experimental designs can be used to compare the different contexts. How development produces covariation between traits can have substantial implications for understanding genetic variation and the potential for evolutionary change, but research in this area has only begun and many questions remain unanswered.},

  abstract = {Identifying the modular components of a configuration of landmarks is an important task of morphometric analyses in evolutionary developmental biology. Modules are integrated internally by many interactions among their component parts, but are linked to one another only by few or weak interactions. Accordingly, traits within modules are tightly correlated with each other, but relatively independent of traits in other modules. Hypotheses concerning the boundaries of modules in a landmark configuration can therefore be tested by comparing the strength of covariation among alternative partitions of the configuration into subsets of landmarks. If a subdivision coincides with the true boundaries between modules, the correlations among subsets should be minimal. This article introduces Escoufier's RV coefficient and the multi-set RV coefficient as measures of the correlation between two or more subsets of landmarks. These measures can be compared between alternative partitions of the configuration into subsets. Because developmental interactions are tissue bound, it is sensible to require that modules should be spatially contiguous. I propose a criterion for spatial contiguity for sets of landmarks using an adjacency graph. The new methods are demonstrated with data on shape of the wing in Drosophila melanogaster and the mandible of the house mouse.},

  abstract = {Investigating skeletal adaptations to bipedalism informs our understanding of form–function relationships. The calcaneus is an important skeletal element to study because it is a weight-bearing bone with a critical locomotor role. Although other calcaneal regions have been well studied, we lack a clear understanding of the functional role of the lateral plantar process (LPP). The LPP is a bony protuberance on the inferolateral portion of the calcaneus thought to aid the tuberosity in transmission of ground reaction forces during heel-strike. Here, we analyze LPP internal trabecular structure relative to other calcaneal regions to investigate its potential functional affinities. Human calcanei (n = 20) were micro-CT scanned, and weighted spherical harmonic analysis outputs were used to position 251 volumes of interest (VOI) within each bone. Trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), spacing (Tb.Sp), degree of anisotropy (DA), and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) were calculated for each VOI. Similarities in BV/TV and DA (p = 0.2741) between the LPP and inferior tuberosity support suggestions that the LPP is a weight-bearing structure that may transmit forces in a similar direction. The LPP significantly differs from the inferior tuberosity in Tb.Th and Tb.Sp (p {$<$} 0.05). Relatively thinner, more closely spaced trabeculae in the LPP may serve to increase internal surface area to compensate for its relatively small size compared to the tuberosity. Significant differences in all parameters between LPP and joint articular surfaces indicate that trabecular morphology is differently adapted for the transmission of forces associated with body mass through joints.},

Between 5500 and 4200 cal BC, agriculturalists migrated into northwestern Europe bringing a suite of Neolithic technologies including domesticated animals. Here we investigate to what extent Mesolithic Erteb?lle communities in northern Germany had access to domestic pigs, possibly through contact with neighbouring Neolithic agricultural groups. We employ a multidisciplinary approach, applying sequencing of ancient mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (coat colour-coding gene MC1R) as well as traditional and geometric morphometric (molar size and shape) analyses in Sus specimens from 17 Neolithic and Erteb?lle sites. Our data from 63 ancient pig specimens show that Erteb?lle hunter-gatherers acquired domestic pigs of varying size and coat colour that had both Near Eastern and European mitochondrial DNA ancestry. Our results also reveal that domestic pigs were present in the region \textasciitilde 500 years earlier than previously demonstrated.},

  abstract = {This study compared domestic guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus; DGP) and two different populations of the wild cavy (Cavia aperea), its ancestor, to examine whether rearing of wild mammals in captivity affects their behavior and physiological stress responses. One population of wild cavies consisted of wild-trapped animals and their first laboratory-reared offspring (WGP-1). The animals of the other population were reared in captivity for about 30 generations (WGP-30). The spontaneous behavior of each of six groups of WGP-1 and WGP-30 and nine groups of DGP, each consisting of one adult male and two adult females, was analyzed quantitatively. Blood samples of the males were taken to determine cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations. In addition, the exploratory behavior of 60-day-old male WGP-1, WGP-30, and DGP was investigated in an exploration apparatus. The domesticated animals displayed significantly less aggression, but significantly more sociopositive and male courtship behavior than their wild ancestors. In addition, DGP were much less attentive to their physical environment. Surprisingly, no behavioral difference was found between WGP-1 and WGP-30. Basal cortisol concentrations did not differ between wild and domestic guinea pigs. Catecholamine concentrations, however, as well as the challenge values of cortisol, were distinctly reduced in the DGP. WGP-1 and WGP-30 did not differ with respect to their endocrine stress responses. In the exploration apparatus both forms of wild cavies were much more explorative than the domestic animals. These data suggest that the long-term breeding and rearing of wild guinea pigs in captivity do not result in significant changes in behavior and hormonal stress responses. It appears to take much longer periods of time and artificial selection by humans to bring about characters of domestication in wild animals.},

Wolves and humans were both persistent, pack hunters of large prey. They were species competing over resources in partially overlapping ecological niches and capable of killing each other. How could humans possibly have domesticated a competitive species? Here we present a new hypothesis based on food/resource partitioning between humans and incipient domesticated wolves/dogs. Humans are not fully adapted to a carnivorous diet; human consumption of meat is limited by the liver’s capacity to metabolize protein. Contrary to humans, wolves can thrive on lean~meat for months. We present here data showing that all the Pleistocene archeological sites with dog or incipient dog remains are from areas that were analogous to subarctic and arctic environments. Our calculations show that during harsh winters, when game is lean and devoid of fat, Late Pleistocene hunters-gatherers in Eurasia would have a surplus of animal derived protein that could have been shared with incipient dogs. Our partitioning theory explains how competition may have been ameliorated during the initial phase of dog domestication. Following this initial period, incipient dogs would have become docile, being utilized in a multitude of ways such as hunting companions, beasts of burden and guards as well as going through many similar evolutionary changes as humans.},

This represents a considerable increase in the value and amount of information available from these direct measuring techniques. Each stride imposed a definite and characteristic deformation cycle on the bone. On its dorsal side this was primarily compressive and identical in direction and timing in all animals. Strain amplitude and rate of change were comparable to values obtained from other regions in the same species. This agreement tends to support the hypothesis that bone deformation per se may be at least one of the governing stimuli for the remodelling necessary in the maintenance of bone's structure and mechanical strength.},

Despite decades of research, no consensus has emerged about the extent of admixture between the indigenous and exotic populations or the degree to which the appearance of specific components of the “Neolithic cultural package” in Europe reflects truly independent development. Here, through the use of mitochondrial DNA from 323 modern and 221 ancient pig specimens sampled across western Eurasia, we demonstrate that domestic pigs of Near Eastern ancestry were definitely introduced into Europe during the Neolithic (potentially along two separate routes), reaching the Paris Basin by at least the early 4th millennium B.C. Local European wild boar were also domesticated by this time, possibly as a direct consequence of the introduction of Near Eastern domestic pigs. Once domesticated, European pigs rapidly replaced the introduced domestic pigs of Near Eastern origin throughout Europe. Domestic pigs formed a key component of the Neolithic Revolution, and this detailed genetic record of their origins reveals a complex set of interactions and processes during the spread of early farmers into Europe.},

The precise origins and dispersal routes of the Austronesian peoples and the associated Lapita culture remain contentious, and numerous disparate models of dispersal (based primarily on linguistic, genetic, and archeological data) have been proposed. Here, through the use of mtDNA from 781 modern and ancient Sus specimens, we provide evidence for an early human-mediated translocation of the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) to Flores and Timor and two later separate human-mediated dispersals of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) through Island Southeast Asia into Oceania. Of the later dispersal routes, one is unequivocally associated with the Neolithic (Lapita) and later Polynesian migrations and links modern and archeological Javan, Sumatran, Wallacean, and Oceanic pigs with mainland Southeast Asian S. scrofa. Archeological and genetic evidence shows these pigs were certainly introduced to islands east of the Wallace Line, including New Guinea, and that so-called “wild” pigs within this region are most likely feral descendants of domestic pigs introduced by early agriculturalists. The other later pig dispersal links mainland East Asian pigs to western Micronesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines. These results provide important data with which to test current models for human dispersal in the region.},

  abstract = {To what extent is cranial vault thickness (CVT) a character that is strongly linked to the genome, or to what extent does it reflect the activity of an individual prior to skeletal maturity? Experimental data from pigs and armadillos indicate that CVT increases more rapidly in exercised juveniles than in genetically similar controls, despite the low levels of strain generated by chewing or locomotion in the neurocranium. CVT increases in these individuals appear to be a consequence of systemic cortical bone growth induced by exercise. In addition, an analysis of the variability in vault thickness in the genus Homo demonstrates that, until the Holocene, there has been only a slight, general decrease in vault thickness over time with no consistent significant differences between archaic and early anatomically modern humans from the Late Pleistocene. Although there may be some genetic component to variation in CVT, exercise-related, non-genetically heritable stimuli appear to account for most of the variance between individuals. The thick cranial vaults of most hunter-gatherers and early agriculturalists suggests that they may have experienced higher levels of sustained exercise relative to body mass than the majority of recent, post-industrial humans. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {How bones respond dynamically to mechanical loading through changes in shape and structure is poorly understood, particularly with respect to variations between bones. Structurally, cortical bones adapt in vivoto their mechanical environments primarily by modulating two processes,modeling and Haversian remodeling. Modeling, defined here as the addition of new bone, may occur in response to mechanical stimuli by altering bone shape or size through growth. Haversian remodeling is thought to be an adaptation to repair microcracks or prevent microcrack propagation. Here, we examine whether cortical bone in sheep limbs modulates periosteal modeling and Haversian remodeling to optimize strength relative to mass in hind-limb midshafts in response to moderate levels of exercise at different growth stages. Histomorphometry was used to compare rates of periosteal growth and Haversian remodeling in exercised and sedentary treatment groups of juvenile, subadult and young adult sheep. In vivo strain data were also collected for the tibia and metatarsal midshafts of juvenile sheep. The results suggest that limb bones initially optimize responses to loading according to the varying power requirements associated with adding mass at different locations. In juveniles, exercise induces higher rates of periosteal modeling in proximal midshafts and higher rates of Haversian remodeling in distal midshafts. Consequently, distal element midshafts experience higher strains and,presumably, have lower safety factors. As animals age, periosteal modeling rates decline and Haversian remodeling rates increase, but moderate levels of mechanical loading stimulate neither process significantly.},

  abstract = {Dental microwear has been widely used to reconstruct mammals’ past diet and to understand their dental evolution. In archaeology, it can help reconstruct anthropogenic herd-feeding systems. However, deciphering the impact of exogenous mineral particles on dental wear is an ongoing challenge since studies have shown that soil ingestion can generates microwear traces that interfere with the dietary signals. To bridge this gap, this study relies on the first large-scale controlled-food experiment on wild boars (Sus scrofa) to test how soil ingestion can affect the dietary signal recorded in dental microwear. It provides the opportunity to investigate the impact of natural soil ingestion over microwear traces by comparing penned boars that were able to root with stalled boars that were not. We performed 3D Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) on 22 controlled-fed boars kept captive either in an indoor stall with no soil ingestion, or in a wooded pen with natural soil ingestion. We analysed shearing and crushing facets on upper and lower first and second molars using standard texture parameters. We also conducted particle size distribution analyses of the ingested soil. In line with previous works, the consumption of exogenous abrasives in rooting boars leads to less rough, less complex and more anisotropic wear surfaces than in stall-fed boars, even though they received the same diet. Thus, we highly recommend studying DMT when investigating ancient pig husbandry systems, particularly local changes in food management. Overall, this study contributes to a better comprehension of how exogenous abrasives impact DMT among mammals.},

We performed a standard morphologic analysis of the DR and DT with high?resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and used finite?element analysis (FEA) to estimate bone strength (failure load) and the load distribution. We also calculated a DR load?to?strength ratio as an estimate of forearm fracture risk. Total bone area, which was 33\% larger in young men at both sites, changed similarly with age in women and men at the DT but increased 17\% more in men than in women at the DR (p\,\&lt;\,.001). Trabecular number and thickness (Tb.Th) were 7\% to 20\% higher in young men than in young women at both sites, and with the exception of Tb.Th at the DR, which declined more with age in men (?16\%) than in women (?2\%, p\,\&lt;\,.01), the age?related decline in these outcomes was similar in women and in men. In the cortex, porosity (Ct.Po) was 31\% to 44\% lower in young women than in young men but increased 92\% to 176\% more with age in women than in men (p\,\&lt;\,.001). The DR cortex carried 14\% more load in young women than in young men, and the percentage of load carried by the DR cortex did not change with age in women but declined by 17\% in men (p\,\&lt;\,.01). FEA?estimated bone strength was 34\% to 47\% greater in young men, but the predicted change with age was similar in both sexes. In contrast, the load?to?strength ratio increased 27\% more in women than in men with age (p\,\&lt;\,.01). These results highlight important site? and sex?specific differences in patterns of age?related bone loss. In particular, the trends for less periosteal expansion, more porous cortices, and a greater percentage of load carried by the DR cortex in women may underpin sex differences in forearm fracture risk. © 2011 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

  abstract = {It is known that since the beginnings of domestication human communities have, in one way or another, restricted the activity of their livestock in order to gain better control of the animal management process. The exact nature of this human-animal relationship, however, is difficult to assess from faunal remains in the archaeological record through conventional methods. Taking suids as an example, we propose a novel approach to detect differences in activity patterns of animal domesticates using features of cross-sectional geometry (CSG) and histomorphometry. The present study analysed midshaft tibia samples from free-ranging wild boar (n = 40), domestic pigs raised indoors having limited mobility (n = 24) and pigs raised outdoors, free to roam in a paddock (n = 15). Geometric features were found to differ between wild boar and both groups of domestic pigs with regard to the amount of cortical bone (higher in wild boar) as well as in the shape of the bone cross section (more triangular in wild boar). The density of secondary osteons was higher in wild boar than in both groups of pigs. The results were controlled for possible effects of age and weight of the animals and, even though some variables co-vary with these growth-dependent measures, the overall trend of a clear association between activity levels, CSG and micro-morphology can be validated. Thus, the study demonstrates the potential for detecting husbandry systems through the analysis of activity levels reflected in the combined assessment of gross and histo-compositional morphology of a load-bearing long bone.},

  abstract = {The appendicular skeleton of tetrapods is a particularly integrated structure due to the shared developmental origin or similar functional constraints exerted on its elements. Among these constraints, body mass is considered strongly to influence its integration but its effect on shape covariation has rarely been addressed in mammals, especially in heavy taxa. Here, we propose to explore the covariation patterns of the long bones in heavy animals and their link to body mass. We investigate the five modern rhinoceros species, which display an important range of bodyweight. We used a 3D geometric morphometric approach to describe the shape covariation of the six bones composing the stylopodium and zeugopodium both among and within species. Our results indicate that the appendicular skeleton of modern rhinos is a strongly integrated structure. At the interspecific level, the shape covariation is roughly similar between all pairs of bones and mainly concerns the muscular insertions related to powerful flexion and extension movements. The forelimb integration appears higher and more related to body mass than that of the hind limb, suggesting a specialization for weight support. The integration of the stylopodium elements does not seem to relate to body mass in our sample, which suggests a greater effect of shared developmental factors. Conversely, the covariation of the zeugopodium bones seems more associated with body mass, particularly for the radius-ulna pair. The fibula appears poorly integrated with other bones, especially within non-Rhinoceros species, which may represent a case of parcellation due to a functional dissociation between the hind limb bones. The exploration of the integration patterns at the intraspecific level also highlights a more prominent effect of age over individual body mass on shape covariation within C. simum. This study lends support to previous hypotheses indicating a link between high body mass and high integration level.},

ISSN 0024–1164. The morphology of the astragalus is analysed in nineteen Paleogene artiodactyls (suborders Palaeodonta, Suina, Ancodonta and Ruminantia). This morphology is related to the functional adaptations of the appendicular skeleton, but some diagnostic characters can be seen at the family level. For the populations examined, the proportions of this bone show a low intraspecific variability, which does not allow detection of any dimorphism. An allometric relationship between the dimensions of the astragalus and the body mass has been established for extant species, allowing estimates for the fossil species. In most cases, the interval between the two extreme estimations using the astragalus includes the estimated body mass using M/1 area. The limits of this method are discussed, and it is suggested that the dimensions of the astragalus give a better estimation of the body mass than the dental area. ?Artiodactyls, astragalus, comparative morphology, body mass, allometry, Paleogene.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to study in detail compact bone tissue microscopic structure of adult cows and pigs with an emphasis to find an adequate key for the species identification. Altogether 18 femurs were analysed. Each of the bones was sectioned at the smallest breadth of their diaphysis. Specimens were prepared using standard histological equipment, producing thin sections approximately 80–100 ?m thick. The qualitative differences between investigated species were examined in anterior, posterior, medial and lateral views of thin sections. The quantitative ones were counted using the specific computer software Scion Image. We measured the area, perimeter, minimal and maximal diameter of the Haversian canals, the Haversian systems and the vascular canals of primary osteons. After that a discriminant function analysis was used for the species identification. According to our results the basic structural pattern of femur diaphysis was primary vascular plexiform in both species. However, non-vascular bone tissue was identified in cows and resorption lacunae were found between the secondary osteons in pigs. The measured variables of the Haversian canals, the Haversian systems and the primary osteon's vascular canals were higher in most cases in cows. Classification functions for investigated species give a correct classification of 64.69\% of cases. This percentage value can be increased by integrating conclusions from the qualitative analysis.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to study compact bone tissue microstructure of some mammals in terms of qualitative and quantitative characteristics, with an emphasis on finding an adequate identification key. Altogether, 36 femora of adult pigs, cows, sheep and rabbits were analysed. The qualitative characteristics were examined according to the classification systems of Enlow \& Brown (1956) and Ricql?s et al. (1991) in anterior, posterior, medial and lateral views of thin sections. The quantitative characteristics were assessed using the specific software Scion Image (Scion Corporation, US). We measured area, perimeter, and minimum and maximum diameter of the Haversian canals, the secondary osteons and the vascular canals of primary osteons. The observed data were first used to evaluate inter- and intra-species diversity. After that a discriminant function analysis was used for species determination. According to our results the basic structural pattern of the bone tissue was primary vascular plexiform in pigs, cows and sheep. We found dense Haversian bone tissue in all species. In addition, non-vascular bone tissue was identified in cows and/or primary vascular longitudinal tissue in rabbits. Many resorption lacunae were found between secondary osteons in pigs. The irregular Haversian bone tissue was localised at the periosteal and endosteal borders in sheep. Classification functions for all investigated species gave a correct classification in 73.83\% of cases. The most discriminating variables for the compact bone tissue appeared to be perimeter and minimum diameter of primary osteon's vascular canals. The percentage value can be increased by integrating conclusions from the qualitative analysis. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Leopards (Panthera pardus) are the most numerous large predator and create problems by killing livestock. Both small and young wild ungulates, as well as small domestic stock, provide prey so that the leopards achieve unusually high densities. This study, using radio-tagging techniques, examines the spatial relationships between resident and transient leopards on a 200 km? ranch in the Lolldaiga Hills. About 25 leopards (including estimates of subadults and cubs) live on the ranch. Typically, females occupy exclusive home-ranges of mean extent 14.0 km? although there is some overlap with subadult females. The home-ranges of resident males, with a mean of 32.8 km?, do not overlap each other but do overlap female territories. Transient males move through the area. Analysis of home-range and home-range occupancy, was carried out using three methods: minimum convex polygon, grid cell, and harmonic mean. The information provided by these three different methods is compared, and the social status of the leopards is discussed.},

However, the drivers and mechanisms of the species' spatial ecology remain poorly understood. Thanks to a recently developed framework, the movement ecology of any organism can now be tackled within a consistent and unified theoretical approach. Based on this framework, we reviewed the literature on wild boar movement ecology to assess current knowledge and to identify important gaps. By using important navigational (e.g. olfactory sense) and cognitive (e.g. spatial memory, learning from conspecifics) abilities, wild boar have developed complex movement strategies to cope with external factors. However, there is a lack of detailed information on the role played by the internal state (motivation) and motion capacity in shaping the spatial ability of the species. Specific aspects of the movement ecology of the wild boar, together with its high diet plasticity and its high prolificacy, are probably the most important causes of the rapid spread of wild boar worldwide. We hope our review will inspire other scientists to apply their biological models to the movement ecology paradigms. Furthermore, we suggest that future researchers dealing with the movement ecology of any species should explicitly state the components and interactions of the framework investigated to facilitate further understanding and comparison among studies.},

In addition, confinement-specific stressors such as restricted movement, reduced retreat space, forced proximity to humans, reduced feeding opportunities, maintenance in abnormal social groups, and other restrictions of behavioral opportunity are considered. Research in support of the claims for these environmental elements as stressors for captive animals reveals no unique suite of behavioral or physiological responses that will clearly indicate the cause of those responses; rather, it is up to us as managers and caretakers of animals in captivity to evaluate enclosures and husbandry practices to ensure the optimal well-being of animals in our care.},

  abstract = {In the early-Holocene, animal domestication processes entailed important changes to the subsistence strategies of Neolithic populations. Among the first domestic species, pigs played a key role as they soon came to be one of the main sources of meat. Several methodological approaches have been followed in archaeology to differentiate between wild and domestic forms in the faunal remains found at early Neolithic sites. Among these, biometry is essential. The biometric analysis applied to a significant sample of Sus domesticus and Sus scrofa remains from 53 sites in the Iberian Peninsula dated between 10,000 and 800 cal. BC reveals differential dynamics between the wild and domestic forms resulting from changes in the climate during that time and the increasingly systematic selective pressure of husbandry. Whereas the wild animals increased in size, the inverse tendency is documented in the domestic population, which gradually decreased in size after the early Neolithic. The point of greatest divergence is seen in the Bronze Age. Significant differences are also documented in different geographic areas, which corroborates the influence of climate on the physical characteristics of wild populations. The range of variability in each population also differs chronologically as it is relatively greater in the Neolithic, which may be connected with the existence of different ways of adopting and breeding domestic pig among the first Neolithic communities, some of which may have involved continuous cross-breeding between the two populations. The results are an initial point of reference for the classification of archaeological remains of prehistoric pig in the Iberian Peninsula, a key area for the study of the dynamics of neolithisation.},

Nevertheless, this approach has never been applied to the earliest pigs in the Iberian Peninsula. We analysed the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition of pig bone collagen from several Early Neolithic sites in the NE Iberian Peninsula. While pig ?13C values were similar across different populations, there were significant differences in ?15N values between sites.

  abstract = {The domestication process is associated with substantial phenotypic changes through time. However, although morphological integration between biological structures is purported to have a major influence on the evolution of new morphologies, little attention has been paid to the influence of domestication on the magnitude of integration. Here, we assessed the influence of constraints associated with captivity, considered as one of the crucial first steps in the domestication process, on the integration of cranial and mandibular structures. We investigated the craniomandibular integration in Western European Sus scrofa using three-­dimensional (3D) landmark-­ based geometric morphometrics. Our results suggest that captivity is associated with a lower level of integration between the cranium and the mandible. Plastic responses to captivity can thus affect the magnitude of integration of key functional structures. These findings underline the critical need to develop integration studies in the context of animal domestication to better understand the processes accountable for the set-­up of domestic phenotypes through time.},

  abstract = {Deciphering the plastic (i.e., nonheritable) changes induced by human control over wild animals in the archeological record is challenging. Previous studies detected morphological markers associated with captivity in the cranium, mandible, and calcaneus of adult wild boar (Sus scrofa) but the developmental trajectories leading up to these changes during ontogeny remain unknown. To assess the impact of growth in a captive environment on morphological structures during postnatal ontogeny, we used an experimental approach focusing on the same three structures and taxon. We investigated the form and size differences of captive?reared and wildcaught wild boar during growth using three?dimensional landmark?based geometric morphometrics. Our results provide evidence of an influence of captivity on the morphology of craniomandibular structures, as wild specimens are smaller than captive individuals at similar ages. The food resources inherent to anthropogenic environments may explain some of the observed differences between captivereared and wild specimens. The calcaneus presents a different contrasted pattern of plasticity as captive and wild individuals differ in terms of form but not in terms of size. The physically more constrained nature of the calcaneus and the direct influence of mobility reduction on this bone may explain these discrepancies. These results provide new methodological perspectives for bioarchaeological approaches as they imply that the plastic mark of captivity can be observed in juvenile specimens in the same way it has been previously described in adults.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Feralization is the process by which domestic animals return to the wild and produce self-sustaining populations. It is often considered as a model in understanding the permanence of morphological changes associated with domestication; however, it is still unclear how much the release of anthropogenic selective pressures affects domestic traits. Here, we assessed the influence of feralization on the domestic morphological traits acquired through selective breeding using craniomandibular differences in shape and size between populations of feral pigs, wild boar and domestic pigs, using landmark-based geometric morphometrics. Our results suggest that numerous cranial and mandibular traits associated with domestication still exist in feral specimens, corroborating that domestication-induced changes in the shape of morphological elements are broadly maintained in feral populations. This is not the case for size variations, however, as the cranium is significantly smaller in feral pigs than in domesticated breeds, which could be due to the selective pressures associated with founding events. Our exploratory study, therefore, underlines the complexity of feral population history, the intricate influence of variations in genetic diversity, and novel selection pressures in the morphology of these groups. Future studies will need to expand the sample to take into account the diversity of morphotypes.},

  abstract = {The process of animal domestication is a key evolutionary transition in human history, within which the control of wild populations is considered a crucial first step. Yet, phenotypic changes associated with animal captivity remain challenging to document. Here, we investigated the craniofacial changes in wild boar (Sus scrofa) associated with a lifetime of growth in captivity under conditions of controlled mobility and diet. Using three-dimensional landmark-based geometric morphometrics, we assessed cranial and mandibular size and shape differences between captive and wild-caught wild boar, their link with masticatory forces, and how these plastic changes relate to traits selected in domestic pigs. We observed shape divergence associated with greater masticatory forces in captive wild boar (e.g., wider zygomatic arches, more upright mandibular rami, and reduced gonial angle) corroborating the fundamental role of biomechanical loading and constructional constraints in the skull shape changes associated with captivity. Despite their resemblance with domestic traits, these localised plastic changes follow a different phenotypic trajectory, suggesting that they did not contribute to the setup of the craniofacial morphology of current domestic breeds. A parallel increase of masticatory force in captive wild boars and domestic pigs may explain this phenotypic convergence but needs to be further explored.},

We review the evidence for changes in a wide variety of mammalian taxa, with non-mammalian examples where relevant. 2 We consider the morphological effects of the process of domestication, and compare changes in both hard and soft tissues in captive and domestic animals with those in their wild counterparts. These include skull shape differences, brain size reduction, postcranial adaptations and digestive tract changes. 3 We also summarize studies that have looked at morphological change in feral animals in comparison with their wild and domestic ancestors, and consider their use as an analogue for morphological change in captive-bred animals that have been released into the wild. 4 We then discuss the importance of this work for the wider aims of conservation of endangered species and captive breeding over many generations, and emphasize the importance of studying these changes now, while for many species, the process is just beginning rather than many generations down the line, or immediately prior to release, where survival of captive-bred animals may be severely compromised.},

  abstract = {Zooarcheological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated in Southwest Asia ?8,500 BC. They then spread across the Middle and Near East and westward into Europe alongside early agriculturalists. European pigs were either domesticated independently or more likely appeared so as a result of admixture between introduced pigs and European wild boar. As a result, European wild boar mtDNA lineages replaced Near Eastern/Anatolian mtDNA signatures in Europe and subsequently replaced indigenous domestic pig lineages in Anatolia. The specific details of these processes, however, remain unknown. To address questions related to early pig domestication, dispersal, and turnover in the Near East, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA and dental geometric morphometric variation in 393 ancient pig specimens representing 48 archeological sites (from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic to the Medieval period) from Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Our results reveal the first genetic signatures of early domestic pigs in the Near Eastern Neolithic core zone. We also demonstrate that these early pigs differed genetically from those in western Anatolia that were introduced to Europe during the Neolithic expansion. In addition, we present a significantly more refined chronology for the introduction of European domestic pigs into Asia Minor that took place during the Bronze Age, at least 900 years earlier than previously detected. By the 5th century AD, European signatures completely replaced the endemic lineages possibly coinciding with the widespread demographic and societal changes that occurred during the Anatolian Bronze and Iron Ages.},

Zooarchaeologists have attempted to study these changes osteologically in their search for the geographic and temporal origins of initial animal domestication during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Traditional biometric approaches have explored broad changes in body size over time, but this approach provides poor resolution. Here we investigate whether geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of cranial shape can be used to provide better resolution between wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), since shape is less affected by environmental factors than size. GMM combined with traditional multivariate statistics were applied to the crania of 42 modern domestic pigs (representing 6 breeds), 10 wild~?~domestic first generation hybrid pigs and 55 adult wild boar. Further analyses were carried out on morphologically discrete portions of the crania to simulate the fragmented nature of archaeological mammal remains. We found highly significant discrimination between wild and domestic pigs, both on the whole crania, and subsets including the parietal, the basicranium, the angle of the nasal and the zygomatic. We also demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate different domestic breeds on the basis of cranial morphology, and that 1st generation hybrid wild~?~domestic pig morphology more closely resembles wild pigs than domestic, suggesting that a wild phenotype (here represented by morphology) is dominant over a recessive domestic one. Our data demonstrate that GMM techniques can provide a quantifiable, clear classification between wild and domestic Sus (even using partial cranial remains) which has significant implications for zooarchaeological research.},

  abstract = {The trabeculae of the cancellous bone are formed along the direction of the lines of stresses to which a bone is subjected. The talus sustains the weight of the body and transmits the weight in different directions (i.e., the calcaneus and navicular). The aim of the present study was to investigate the architecture of the cancellous bone of the talus to understand the mechanism of transmission of force within the bone. Twenty-five dry, macerated tali of adult male humans were used to study the trabecular architecture. In a few bones, serial longitudinal (parasagittal), transverse (coronal), and horizontal sections were cut; in other bones, the trabecular bone was exposed by removal of cortical bone. Trabecular architecture was studied by dissection microscope and by taking radiographs of the slices. The body of the talus consisted of vertical, parallel plates arranged posteroanteriorly. This kind of orientation of the plates facilitates the transmission of weight, when the tibia rolls posteroanteriorly on the trochlear surface during walking. The trabecular architecture in the head of talus consisted of semiarched plates running parallel to each other. The vertical limb of these semiarched plates were situated above the middle and anterior calcaneal facets on the plantar surface of the head, whereas the horizontal limbs of the arches were deep to the navicular articular surface of the head. The vertical plates of the body and semiarched plates of the head were interconnected by a meshwork of irregularly arranged trabecular bone of the neck. The architecture of this meshwork was such that it could facilitate the change in the direction and nature of force. In conclusion, the part of compressive force, acting vertically downward on the body of the talus during standing, was converted to tensile force in the neck, and its direction was made perpendicular to enable this force to go toward the head of the talus. In a similar manner, the semiarched pattern of plates in the head facilitated the change in the direction of the force, at the end of the stance phase, from the downward (toward calcaneus) to the forward (toward navicular) direction.

  abstract = {It is proposed that there are two structurally different forms of bone loss with different rates, cellular mechanisms, and biomechanical effects. Rapid bone loss is the result of excessive depth of osteoclastic resorption cavities. This leads in trabecular bone to perforation of structural elements, increased size of marrow cavities, and discontinuity of the bone structure, and in cortical bone to subendosteal cavitation and conversion of the inner third of the cortex to a trabecularlike structure, which then undergoes the same changes as the trabecular bone originally present. These structural characteristics reduce the strength of the bones to a greater extent than the reduction in the amount of bone by itself would suggest. Slow bone loss results from incomplete refilling by osteoblasts of resorption cavities of normal or reduced size. This leads to simple thinning of residual structural elements in both trabecular and cortical bone, and reduces the strength of the bones in proportion to the reduction in the amount of bone. This concept, although derived mainly from an examination of postmenopausal bone loss, may be applicable to other osteopenic states. At the same time as bone loss is occurring on the endosteal surface, rapidly or slowly, bone is being added to the periosteal surface, but much more slowly than during growth. The cellular mechanism is the converse of that causing slow bone loss, consisting of slight overfilling of shallow resorption cavities. Slow periosteal gain serves to partly offset the structural weakness resulting from endosteal loss, but is not directly compensatory. Although less well established and of uncertain frequency and magnitude, it is likely that localized bone gain also occurs on some trabecular surfaces, especially the vertical trabecular plates in the spine that are subjected to compression. In contrast to periosteal gain, this may be a compensatory response to loss of horizontal trabeculae, but the cellular mechanism is unknown.},

  abstract = {Locomotor habits in mammals are strongly tied to limb bones’ lengths, diameters, and proportions. By comparison, fewer studies have examined how limb bone cross-sectional traits relate to locomotor habit. Here, we tested whether climbing, digging, and swimming locomotor habits reflect biomechanically meaningful differences in three cross-sectional traits rendered dimensionless— cross-sectional area (CSA), second moments of area (SMA), and section modulus (MOD)—using femora, tibiae, and fibulae of 28 species of mustelid. CSA and SMA represent resistance to axial compression and bending, respectively, whereas MOD represents structural strength. Given the need to counteract buoyancy in aquatic environments and soil’s high density, we predicted that natatorial and fossorial mustelids have higher values of cross-sectional traits. For all three traits, we found that natatorial mustelids have the highest values, followed by fossorial mustelids, with both of these groups significantly differing from scansorial mustelids. However, phylogenetic relatedness strongly influences diversity in cross-sectional morphology, as locomotor habit strongly correlates with phylogeny. Testing whether hind limb bone cross-sectional traits have evolved adaptively, we fit Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) and Brownian motion (BM) models of trait diversification to cross-sectional traits. The cross-sectional traits of the femur, tibia, and fibula appear to have, respectively, diversified under a multi-rate BM model, a single rate BM model, and a multi-optima OU model. In light of recent studies on mustelid body size and elongation, our findings suggest that the mustelid body plan—and perhaps that of other mammals—is likely the sum of a suite of traits evolving under different models of trait diversification.},

  abstract = {The premise that bones grow and remodel throughout life to adapt to their mechanical enironment is often called Wolff's law. Wolff's law, however, is not always true, and in fact comprises a variety of different processes that are best considered separately. Here we review the molecular and physiological mechanisms by which bone senses, transduces, and responds to mechanical loads, and the effects of aging processes on the relationship (if any) between cortical bone form and mechanical function. Experimental and comparative evidence suggests that cortical bone is primarily responsive to strain prior to sexual maturity, both in terms of the rate of new bone growth (modeling) as well as rates of turnover (Haversian remodeling). Rates of modeling and Haversian remodeling, however, vary greatly at different skeletal sites. In addition, there is no simple relationship between the orientation of loads in long bone diaphyses and their cross-sectional geometry. In combination, these data caution against assuming without testing adaptationist views about form-function relationships in order to infer adult activity patterns from skeletal features such as cross-sectional geometry, cortical bones density, and musculo-skeletal stress markers. Efforts to infer function from shape in the human skeleton should be based on biomechanical and developmental models that are experimentally tested and validated.

  abstract = {The emergence of pastoralism and animal husbandry has been a critical point in the history of human evolution. Beyond profound behavioural changes in domesticated animals compared to wild ones, characterising the morphological changes associated with domestication process remains challenging. Because reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) can be considered to still be in the early phases of the domestication process, the study of modern populations provides a unique opportunity to examine the impact of captivity and selective breeding on skeletal changes. In this work, we investigated the morphological changes in long limb bone cross-sections using 137 wild and domestic reindeer individuals bred in free-range, in captivity or used for racing and pulling. The shape and shaft cortical thickness of the six long limb bones (i.e., humerus, radioulna, metacarpal, femur, tibia and metatarsal) were measured using a 2D-geometric morphometrics approach taking into account subspecies, sex, body mass and lifestyle differences. These bones are important to understanding functional morphological changes because they can provide information on feeding and locomotor behaviours, as well as on body propulsion and weight bearing. Apart from the effects of taxonomy, etho-ecology and sex, we have found that captivity and selection induced important variations in the size and body mass of modern reindeer. Our results also showed that patterns of variation in cortical bone thickness of long limb bone cross-sections were strongly impacted by body mass and human-imposed restrictions in roaming. This demonstrates that bone cross-sections can provide information on changes in locomotor, reproductive and feeding behaviours induced by the domestication process. These results are valuable not only for (paleo) biologists studying the impact of captivity and selection in ungulates but also for archaeologists exploring the origins of domestication and early herding strategies.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that evolutionary changes can occur on a contemporary time scale. Hence, evolution can influence ecology and vice-versa. To understand the importance of eco-evolutionary dynamics in population dynamics, we must quantify the relative contribution of ecological and evolutionary changes to population growth and other ecological processes. To date, however, most eco-evolutionary dynamics studies have not partitioned the relative contribution of plastic and evolutionary changes in traits on population, community, and ecosystem processes. Here, we quantify the effects of heritable and non-heritable changes in body mass distribution on survival, recruitment, and population growth in wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and compare their importance to the effects of changes in age structure, population density, and weather. We applied a combination of a pedigree-based quantitative genetics model, statistical analyses of demography, and a new statistical decomposition technique, the Geber method, to a long-term data set of bighorn sheep on Ram Mountain (Canada), monitored individually from 1975 to 2012. We show three main results: (1) The relative importance of heritable change in mass, non-heritable change in mass, age structure, density, and climate on population growth rate changed substantially over time. (2) An increase in body mass was accompanied by an increase in population growth through higher survival and recruitment rate. (3) Over the entire study period, changes in the body mass distribution of ewes, mostly through non-heritable changes, affected population growth to a similar extent as changes in age structure or in density. The importance of evolutionary changes was small compared to that of other drivers of changes in population growth but increased with time as evolutionary changes accumulated. Evolutionary changes became increasingly important for population growth as the length of the study period considered increased. Our results highlight the complex ways in which ecological and evolutionary changes can affect population dynamics and illustrate the large potential effect of trait changes on population processes.},

  abstract = {The lifestyle of extinct tetrapods is often difficult to assess when clear morphological adaptations such as swimming paddles are absent. According to the hypothesis of bone functional adaptation, the architecture of trabecular bone adapts sensitively to physiological loadings. Previous studies have already shown a clear relation between trabecular architecture and locomotor behavior, mainly in mammals and birds. However, a link between trabecular architecture and lifestyle has rarely been examined. Here, we analyzed trabecular architecture of different clades of reptiles characterized by a wide range of lifestyles (aquatic, amphibious, generalist terrestrial, fossorial, and climbing). Humeri of squamates, turtles, and crocodylians have been scanned with microcomputed tomography. We selected spherical volumes of interest centered in the proximal metaphyses and measured trabecular spacing, thickness and number, degree of anisotropy, average branch length, bone volume fraction, bone surface density, and connectivity density. Only bone volume fraction showed a significant phylogenetic signal and its significant difference between squamates and other reptiles could be linked to their physiologies. We found negative allometric relationships for trabecular thickness and spacing, positive allometries for connectivity density and trabecular number and no dependence with size for degree of anisotropy and bone volume fraction. The different lifestyles are well separated in the morphological space using linear discriminant analyses, but a cross-validation procedure indicated a limited predictive ability of the model. The trabecular bone anisotropy has shown a gradient in turtles and in squamates: higher values in amphibious than terrestrial taxa. These allometric scalings, previously emphasized in mammals and birds, seem to be valid for all amniotes. Discriminant analysis has offered, to some extent, a distinction of lifestyles, which however remains difficult to strictly discriminate. Trabecular architecture seems to be a promising tool to infer lifestyle of extinct tetrapods, especially those involved in the terrestrialization.},

  abstract = {From the very beginning sheep keepers (un-)consciously selected animals with traits amenable to life and reproduction in an anthropogenic environment. Over the millennia sheep lineages developed which were adapted to the diverse landscapes and climates currently inhabited by the species. With time, human selection also fostered desired traits, such as docility, higher average milk production, abundant fleece or excessive fat depots, amongst others. However, verifying their appearance in the archaeological record is quite difficult applying standard archaeozoological methods. Here we present a Geometric Morphometric (GMM) approach that can shed light on these developments. Our study compares astragali of three wild and five domestic sheep populations. They come from prehistoric contexts in SW Asia dating to the Early Neolithic, Middle Chalcolithic and Late Bronze Age as well as modern reference series housed in natural history collections. We observe that ancient and modern wild sheep share the same astragalar morphology. Moreover, domestic sheep from Middle Chalcolithic Central Anatolia still resemble closely their Neolithic SE Anatolian wild relatives. Modern sheep populations from the United Kingdom and NW Germany form a distinct cluster, whereas sheep populations from Late Bronze Age Syria and particularly modern Karakul sheep clearly position away from all of the aforementioned groups, underscoring their distinct morphology. We conclude that the phenotypes preserved in the astragalar size and shape are at the same time a reflection of the respective population's geography, chronology and genetics.},

  abstract = {Women with osteoporosis treated for 36 months with twice?yearly injections of denosumab sustained fewer hip fractures compared with placebo. Treatment might improve femoral bone at locations where fractures typically occur. To test this hypothesis, we used 3D cortical bone mapping of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to investigate the timing and precise location of denosumab versus placebo effects in the hips. We analyzed clinical computed tomography scans from 80 female participants in FREEDOM, a randomized trial, wherein half of the study participants received subcutaneous denosumab 60\,mg twice yearly and the others received placebo. Cortical 3D bone thickness maps of both hips were created from scans at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 months. Cortical mass surface density maps were also created for each visit. After registration of each bone to an average femur shape model followed by statistical parametric mapping, we visualized and quantified statistically significant treatment effects. The technique allowed us to pinpoint systematic differences between denosumab and control and to display the results on a 3D average femur model. Denosumab treatment led to an increase in femoral cortical mass surface density and thickness, already evident by the third injection (12 months). Overall, treatment with denosumab increased femoral cortical mass surface density by 5.4\% over 3 years. One?third of the increase came from increasing cortical density, and two?thirds from increasing cortical thickness, relative to placebo. After 36 months, cortical mass surface density and thickness had increased by up to 12\% at key locations such as the lateral femoral trochanter versus placebo. Most of the femoral cortex displayed a statistically significant relative difference by 36 months. Osteoporotic cortical bone responds rapidly to denosumab therapy, particularly in the hip trochanteric region. This mechanism may be involved in the robust decrease in hip fractures observed in denosumab?treated women at increased risk of fracture. © 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

The project investigates a population of 356 unimproved Shetland sheep skeletons evenly distributed between females bred at different ages, males and castrates, raised on either high or low nutritional planes. This first instalment focuses on two aspects of our larger study, namely bone growth and epiphyseal fusion as affected by sex, castration and nutrition. Nutrition, sex and castration are shown to influence bone growth in ways that are often element-dependant and not consistent through time. We demonstrate that metric variability (variance) is strongest in males, with little difference between females and castrates, and that, in our sample, nutrition has little influence on variance in any sex cohort. Of importance to the development of models of past animal management this study demonstrates that the standard epiphyseal fusion ranges used by zooarchaeologists are too narrow in most instances and do not account for the large variation between sexes or the lesser variation between planes of nutrition. We recommend methods for recognizing castration and the presence of more than one sheep breed, or type, within the zooarchaeological record.},

While recognizing contextual contingency, we propose several “pathways” to pig domestication. We also highlight the diversity of pig management practices. This diversity complicates zooarchaeological detection of management techniques employed by humans in the early steps of domestication, and we stress the need for multiple lines of evidence. Drawing together the evidence, we review early Holocene human–Sus relations in Japan, Cyprus, northern Mesopotamia, and China. Independent pig domestication occurred in northern Mesopotamia by c. 7500~cal. BC and China by c. 6000~cal. BC. In northern Mesopotamia pig domestication followed a combined “commensal and prey” pathway that evolved into loose “extensive” husbandry that persisted as the dominant form of pig management for several millennia. There are not yet enough zooarchaeological data to speculate on the early stages of pig domestication in China, but once that process began, it involved more intensive management (relying on pens and fodder), leading to more rapid selection for phenotypes associated with domestication. Finally, pig domestication “failed” to take off in Japan. We suggest this was related to a number of factors including the lack of domestic crops and, potentially, cultural barriers to conceiving animals as property.},

Scholars have long been interested in the pig’s unique history, especially in the northern Fertile Crescent (NFC), the region in which the first steps towards pig domestication took place in the 9th-8th millennia cal. BC. Yet, few zooarchaeologists have studied the morphological changes in pigs and other animals over the long term, especially in the periods after the initial appearance of domesticates. We combine Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) and more traditional biometrics to demonstrate how suid morphology evolved over a long timespan: 11,000-2000 cal. BC. Our GMM and biometrical data from Jarmo and Domuztepe, Neolithic sites occupied after the first domestic pigs emerged in the region, show that wild boar continued to play important roles in human-suid relations. More generally, our data show a gradual reduction in size and the attainment of a “morphological plateau” in the 4th millennium cal. BC. We suggest that these changes reflect 1) the evolution of pig husbandry practices over time in response to deforestation, intensive agriculture, and urbanism; and 2) a reduction in the frequency of hybridizations between wild boar and domestic pigs.},

In this paper, we present the first large-scale synthesis of biometrical data from pigs and wild boar in the southern Levant from sites dating from the Paleolithic through the Islamic period. We show broad morphological change over this multi-millennium period. We find the first evidence of morphological change associated with domestication in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (c. 7000-6400~cal. BC), at the site of Motza. This date is contemporaneous with the first evidence from kill-off patterns and relative abundance data indicating management of morphologically wild boar. Taken together, we argue for a process of local pig domestication. We also present tentative evidence for increased body size correlating with the genetic replacement in the Iron Age, when European-derived mitochondrial haplogroups replaced those of local origin. Finally, the data indicate variability in tooth size in the Roman period (c. 63 BCE – 330 CE), suggesting the exploitation of different populations of pigs. The data suggest sophisticated management techniques underwrote the upsurge in pig husbandry in the Levant in the Classical period.},

  abstract = {Recent work at Hallan ?emi and other round house horizon sites in eastern Anatolia indicates that the Taurus-Zagros flanks were a second autochthonous center of neolithization in southwestern Asia. Fully settled complex hunter-gatherer societies are in existence in this area by the late Younger Dryas. These settled village societies were based on adaptations that did not involve cereal exploitation, presumably because cereals were absent in this area during the late Younger Dryas. Instead, these adaptations revolved around the exploitation of nuts and pulses, plus the hunting of ovicaprids and deer supplemented by early experiments with animal husbandry involving pigs. They are thus distinct from those that served as the foundation for the earliest sedentary societies in the Levant. Most current attempts to explain the beginnings of settled village life in southwestern Asia are based solely on Levantine data, which until recently were virtually all that were available. The Anatolian data do not conform to the Levantine pattern and thus raise serious questions about the general validity of these models. Les travaux r?cents conduits ? Hallan ?emi et sur d'autres sites qui se placent en Anatolie orientale sur l'horizon ? maisons circulaires indiquent que les flancs du Taurus-Zagros furent un deuxi?me centre autochtone de n?olithisation en Asie du sud-ouest.

Metrical methods are the most commonly used; these are reviewed. Assemblages containing a wider range of measurements (as measured by the coefficient of variation [V]) than is found in one population suggest that two populations of different-sized pigs were present, probably indicating separate wild and domestic populations with little or no interbreeding. These assemblages, sometimes taken to indicate animals ‘intermediate’ between wild and domestic, are clear evidence of full domestication. Other traditional means of diagnosing domestication based on age at death (the killing of many young animals) and biogeography (the export of the animal beyond its natural range, especially to islands) are particularly problematic when applied to pigs. New methods include the frequency of Linear Enamel Hypoplasia, which may increase due to domestication-induced stress, the study of diet through isotopes and dental microwear, and the examination of population histories through ancient and modern DNA and geometric morphometrics. These are all promising but should not be considered in isolation: many problems remain.},

  abstract = {Recent work on the four major areas of the spread of agriculture in Neolithic western Europe has revealed that they are both chronologically and economically much more abrupt than has hitherto been envisaged. Most claims of a little agriculture in Late Mesolithic communities are shown to be incorrect. In most places, full sedentary agriculture was introduced very rapidly at the start of the Neolithic. “Transitional” economies are virtually absent. Consequently, the long-term processes of internal development from forager to farmer, so often discussed in Mesolithic-Neolithic Europe, are increasingly hard to sustain. The spread of agriculture by immigration is thus an increasingly viable explanation. The crucial role of boats for transport and of dairying for the survival of new farming settlements are both highlighted. Farming migrations were punctuated and sporadic, not a single wave of advance. Consequently, there was much genetic mixing as farming spread, so that agricultural immigrants into any region carried a majority of native European Mesolithic genes, not Near Eastern ones.},

This paper examines these claims, and argues that there are no metrical grounds for separating a few bones of these species from the larger number of wild cattle and pigs. All the claimed domestic specimens are therefore most probably wild. Small cattle bones from the Erteb?lle of Denmark are now referred to as wild aurochs. Contemporary claimed domestic and ‘transitional’ specimens from Rosenhof and Bregentwedt/F?rstermoor in northern Germany are so close in size to these that they too are probably wild; the concept of ‘transitional’ cattle is criticized. Claimed ‘transitional’ pigs in northern Germany are likewise probably wild. In Spain, mesolithic/early neolithic pigs are claimed from Sarsa, Parralejo and Nerja via a comparison with the wild and domestic size ranges from Zambujal in Portugal. It is argued that (i) the wild range at Zambujal is not fully known; and (ii) Zambujal is in any case an inappropriate comparison because prehistoric wild boar were smaller in the south and east of Iberia. Fewer comparanda are available when studying Iberian cattle, so the situation is less clear; but neither the pigs nor the cattle are demonstrably domestic. The paper concludes by mentioning other areas of Europe where a similar approach might be fruitful.},

Using an automated technique, cross-sectional geometric properties used in structural analyses (areas, second moments of area) were determined at midshaft and distal to the lesser trochanter in 20 adults from each group. A significant decline in magnitude of almost every geometric property occurs in the agricultural group. The differences between groups are reduced but still significant for many properties after standardizing for bone length differences. In addition, a remodeling of the femoral cortex to one of relatively smaller medullary and subperiosteal diameter, as well as a more circular cross-sectional shape, is characteristic of agricultural femora. Thus, while the relative cross-sectional area of bone remains the same, the spatial distribution of bone area is different in the two groups. The results strongly suggest a relative reduction in mechanical loadings of the femur in the agricultural group, implying different levels and possibly types of activity involving the lower limb in the two groups. The data are also compared with similar data available for the Pecos Pueblo (agricultural) sample. The comparison indicates that types of activity may have been more similar in the two agricultural samples, but that general levels of activity were more similar in the Pecos Pueblo and Georgia coast preagricultural samples.},

  abstract = {“Wolff's law” is a concept that has sometimes been misrepresented, and frequently misunderstood, in the anthropological literature. Although it was originally formulated in a strict mathematical sense that has since been discredited, the more general concept of “bone functional adaptation” to mechanical loading (a designation that should probably replace “Wolff's law”) is supported by much experimental and observational data. Objections raised to earlier studies of bone functional adaptation have largely been addressed by more recent and better-controlled studies. While the bone morphological response to mechanical strains is reduced in adults relative to juveniles, claims that adult morphology reflects only juvenile loadings are greatly exaggerated. Similarly, while there are important genetic influences on bone development and on the nature of bone's response to mechanical loading, variations in loadings themselves are equally if not more important in determining variations in morphology, especially in comparisons between closely related individuals or species. The correspondence between bone strain patterns and bone structure is variable, depending on skeletal location and the general mechanical environment (e.g., distal vs. proximal limb elements, cursorial vs. noncursorial animals), so that mechanical/behavioral inferences based on structure alone should be limited to corresponding skeletal regions and animals with similar basic mechanical designs. Within such comparisons, traditional geometric parameters (such as second moments of area and section moduli) still give the best available estimates of in vivo mechanical competence. Thus, when employed with appropriate caution, these features may be used to reconstruct mechanical loadings and behavioral differences within and between past populations.

  abstract = {Studies on domestication are blooming, but the developmental bases for the generation of domestication traits and breed diversity remain largely unexplored. Some phenotypic patterns of human neurocristopathies are suggestive of those reported for domesticated mammals and disrupting neural crest developmental programmes have been argued to be the source of traits deemed the ‘domestication syndrome’. These character changes span multiple organ systems and morphological structures. But an in-depth examination within the phylogenetic framework of mammals including domesticated forms reveals that the distribution of such traits is not universal, with canids being the only group showing a large set of predicted features. Modularity of traits tied to phylogeny characterizes domesticated mammals: through selective breeding, individual behavioural and morphological traits can be reordered, truncated, augmented or deleted. Similarly, mammalian evolution on islands has resulted in suites of phenotypic changes like those of some domesticated forms. Many domesticated mammals can serve as valuable models for conducting comparative studies on the evolutionary developmental biology of the neural crest, given that series of their embryos are readily available and that their phylogenetic histories and genomes are well characterized.},

  abstract = {The European wild boar is an important game species, subjected to local extinctions and translocations in the past, and currently enormously and worryingly expanding in some areas where management is urgently required. Understanding the relative roles of ancient and recent events in shaping the genetic structure of this species is therefore not only an interesting scientific issue, but it represents also the basis for addressing future management strategies. In addition, several pig breeds descend from the European wild boar, but the geographical location of the domestication area(s) and the possible introgression of pig genomes into wild populations are still open questions. Here, we analysed the genetic variation in different wild boar populations in Europe. Ten polymorphic microsatellites were typed in 252 wild boars and the mtDNA control region was sequenced in a subset of 145 individuals. Some samples from different pig breeds were also analysed. Our results, which were obtained considering also 612 published mtDNA sequences, suggest that (i) most populations are similarly differentiated, but the major discontinuity is found along the Alps; (ii) except for the Italian populations, European wild boars show the signature of a postglacial demographic expansion; (iii) Italian populations seem to preserve a high proportion of preglaciation diversity; (iv) the demographic decline which occurred in some areas in the last few centuries did not produce a noticeable reduction of genetic variation; (v) signs of human-mediated gene flow among populations are weak, although in some regions the effects of translocations are detectable and a low degree of pig introgression can be identified; (vi) the hypothesis of an independent domestication centre in Italy is not supported by our data, which in turn confirm that Central European wild boar might have represented an important source for domestic breeds. We can therefore conclude that recent human activities had a limited effect on the wild boar genetic structure. It follows that areas with high variation and differentiation represent natural reservoirs of genetic diversity to be protected avoiding translocations. In this context controlling some populations by hunting is not expected to affect significantly genetic variation in this species.},

  abstract = {"The definitive artiodactyl tarsus as it first appears in Lower Eocene deposits represents the abrupt introduction of a basic ordinal character. There are no known intermediate or transitional stages between this tarsus and the presumed ancestral type. Predator pressure must have been an important factor in the apparent rapid evolution of this structure, which had virtually reached the biomechanical limit of specialization by the Lower Eocene. 2. Available evidence indicates that the artiodactyls evolved from the primitive hyopsodontid condylarths, although the tarsus of these early ferungulates is very similar to that of the arctocyonid creodonts. In these types, the astragalus has a shallow tibial trochlea, a wide interarticular sulcus, and a rounded head. The calcaneum has a well-developed interosseous fossa and a robust sustentaculum supporting, in part, the astragalus. 3 The axes of the upper and lower ankle joints and the transverse tarsal joint have been determined for the arctocyonid creodont Claenodon. These axes are oriented in several different planes, suggesting the condition occurring in the tarsus of the chimpanzee and man, which may be close to the generalized eutherian arrangement. The probable motion at each of these joints is discussed. 4. The primitive artiodactyl tarsus differs markedly from the generalized ferungulate type. The astragalus has a deep tibial trochlea, the interarticular sulcus has disappeared in connection with a reorientation of the astragalocalcaneal and sustentacular facets, and the head is trochleated. The calcaneum has lost the interosseous fossa, and the sustentaculum no longer offers direct support to the astragalus. 5. The axes of the three ankle joints have been worked out for Ovis. With the changes in the astragalus and calcaneum noted above, these axes are now oriented in such a manner as to permit rotation of the astragalus in a vertical plane. This motion is demonstrated in a series of X-rays of the foot of a living goat. 6. The ligaments of the artiodactyl tarsus have been modified to permit vertical astragalar rotation. The fibers of the calcaneotibial and superficial calcaneal ligaments are somewhat spiraled in order to maintain effectively the integrity of the ankle joint during this rotation. 7. The transformation of the artiodactyl astragalus and calcaneum from the Claenodon type is described in detail by the use of the deformed co?rdinate method. The limitations of the method are discussed. 8. An attempt is made to describe the function of the artiodactyl tarsus, particularly in relation to astragalar rotation. The astragalus is essentially a cam-like structure that may be considered as a velocity mechanism. It also aids in increasing the angle of application of the crural flexor musculature at the start of the propulsive phase when two tarsal fulcra are probably present, at the upper ankle joint and the transverse tarsal joint"--P. 22-23.},

  abstract = {The character complexes of the various mammalian orders usually appear suddenly with no record of transitional stages from the presumed ancestral stock. The earliest members of the Artiodactyla are recognized positively on the basis of a single complex which is the highly specialized form of the tarsus. Basic similarity in the dentition of the Lower Eocene artiodactyls and a family of primitive Paleocene condylarths indicates that the latter represents the ancestral stock of the even-toed ungulates. The transitional period from the primitive condylarths to the first true artiodactyls had a duration of not more than 15 million years. During this time there was a radical change in the form of tarsal elements and in the orientation of the axes of the three main tarsal joints. The resulting mechanism increased the speed of locomotion and probably reduced the retarding effect at the beginning of the propulsive stride. According to paleontological standards the transition was rapid. It was also essentially rectilinear and continuously adaptive. Selection pressure, probably mostly predator pressure, channeled variation sharply during the entire trend. Preadaptation for the artiodactyl environment was a continuous process, occurring along with adaptation for the preartiodactyl one. The biomechanical limit of specialization for the tarsus was almost reached by the Lower Eocene, greatly reducing the possibility of modification in this complex during the Tertiary. The evolutionary mode involved in the transition was essentially phyletic with some features attributed to quantum evolution.},

  abstract = {The architecture of bone trabeculae is based on the direction of stresses applied to the bone. The human talar dome receives compressive forces from the tibia and, to a much lesser extent, the fibula when standing, walking, and running, and transmits the force downward to the calcaneus through the talar body and anterior to the navicular via the talar head. As a result, the body of the talus has predominately vertical trabeculae. However, here we hypothesize that cartilage degeneration at the articular surface is associated with trabecular angle within the associated bone, as a reflection of joint alignment and/or biomechanics (stability, congruence, angulation, etc). Through measurement of trabecular angle with Fast Fourier Transform Analysis, we show a positive correlation between the cartilage degeneration score of the articular surface of the talar dome and the angle of trabecular deviation from the perpendicular axis of the dome (right talus R=0.75, p{$<$}0.01; left talus R=0.79, p{$<$}0.01).},

L'examen de mobiliers osseux in?dits, provenant d'habitats et de s?pultures, combin? aux donn?es de l'?levage et de la chasse, tente de cerner l'ensemble des ressources, mat?rielles comme id?elles, que l'exploitation animale fournit entre le Ruban?, le Michelsberg et le Chass?en. Une fois structur?, cet ensemble de donn?es conduit ? observer un transfert de la sph?re mat?rielle ? l'id?el concernant la chasse, et ce ? mesure que la soci?t? s'enracine dans la domestication. Autrement dit, l'?conomie se renforce dans l'exploitation des ressources animales domestiques de mani?re assez forte pour influencer l'architecture de l'habitat ; c'est du moins l'id?e que d?fend cet article. En parall?le, la chasse devient un facteur embl?matique et socialement valorisant qui, ? son tour, influence les pratiques fun?raires et, vraisemblablement aussi, ?branle les fondements de la structure sociale qui avait cours jusqu'alors. Ce transfert, qui se produit sur un vaste territoire, de l'ouest europ?en jusqu'aux confins de l'Europe centrale, poss?de ind?niablement une certaine pr?gnance dans l'?volution du N?olithique de cette aire. Son origine sociologique para?t s'imposer, offrant mati?re ? r?viser le processus de la n?olithisation gr?ce ? des arguments tout ? fait diff?rents de ceux qui sont habituellement consid?r?s pour ce sujet. Le recyclage de la pratique concr?te de la chasse vers l'id?el est interpr?t? comme le r?sultat de l'interaction de deux entit?s culturelles bien dissoci?es. En sch?matisant, l'une, ayant la culture de la chasse, serait d'origine m?solithique ; l'autre, ayant la culture des animaux domestiques, serait originaire des colons n?olithiques. La situation est en fait bien plus compliqu?e car les « M?solithiques » pratiqueraient l'?levage tandis que les « N?olithiques » chassent. L'interpr?tation propos?e est fond?e sur l'?volution de la pratique cyn?g?tique et une certaine « sp?cialisation » de celle-ci sur une esp?ce donn?e, le cerf, auquel est conf?r? un statut tr?s particulier. Consid?rant ce nouvel argument, on aboutit ? penser qu 'une p?riode de cohabitation sans m?lange (ou tr?s peu) entre les deux entit?s sociales serait possible tout au long du Ruban? et au sein des villages de cette culture. Les deux entit?s en pr?sence se manifesteraient en habitant des maisons de tailles diff?rentes et en mangeant des viandes sp?cifiques. Ces diff?rences, tr?s subtiles sur le plan mat?riel et difficiles ? d?tecter, masquent en fait des pratiques alimentaires et des habitus profond?ment diff?rents, qui maintiennent une distinction sociale forte entre elles. La cohabitation presque sans m?lange de ces deux entit?s sociales au cours du Ruban? pourrait laisser la place ? un premier ?pisode de fusion ? la fin de cette culture ; cette hypoth?se explicite la fin du Ruban? qui est en m?me temps la fin de la vivacit? de la composante m?solithique d?j? int?gr?e dans les villages de cette culture.

  abstract = {Age-related reductions in the thickness and number of trabeculae in vertebral trabecular bone have been documented by several workers, yet the relative effects of these changes on mechanical properties are not known. We developed a two-dimensional model of human vertebral trabecular bone and investigated its mechanical behavior using finite element analysis. The stress-strain behavior, failure mode, and strain distributions predicted using the model were consistent with those observed for vertebral trabecular bone under compressive loading. Random reductions in the number of trabeculae reduced the modulus and strength of the models two to five times more than uniform reductions in the thickness of trabeculae that caused the same loss of bone volume. For example, randomly removing longitudinal trabeculae to achieve a reduction in density of 10\% reduced the strength by approximately 70\%, whereas removing the same amount of bone by uniformly reducing the thickness of the longitudinal trabeculae only reduced the strength by approximately 20\%. For a simulation of aged bone, in which the thickness and number of trabeculae were reduced concurrently, the strength was 23\% of its intact (“young”) value. When the bone mass of the aged model was restored to its intact level by increasing the thickness but not the number of trabeculae, the strength increased by 60\%, but was still only 37\% of its intact value. These combined findings, based on a two-dimensional, idealized model of vertebral trabecular bone, illustrate the importance of maintaining trabecular number and suggest that it may not be possible to restore bone strength following a period of advanced bone loss if a substantial number of trabeculae have been resorbed. Thus, until treatments exist that can increase trabecular number, the most effective treatment strategy is to prevent the degradation of bone strength by maintaining the number of trabeculae at a healthy level.},

  abstract = {For over a century, the arched trabecular patterns of the human proximal femur have been considered to resemble tension and compression stress trajectories produced by stereotypical bending loads. This reflects conventional modeling of the human femoral neck–head region as a short cantilevered beam. Although this conception is the foundation of many biomechanical, clinical, paleontological, and comparative morphological studies of trabecular bone in various species, attempts have not been made to contrast these data to a bone that could be considered a ‘control’ for simple/stereotypical bending. We quantified trabecular architectural characteristics in sheep and deer calcanei as a first step in potentially establishing them as ‘controls’ in this context because they have arched trabecular patterns that resemble tension/compression stress trajectories, and have been shown by strain gauge measurements to be relatively simply loaded in bending. Using micro-computed tomography, calcanei from adult domesticated sheep and wild deer were analyzed where in the dorsal ‘compression’ and plantar ‘tension’ trabecular tracts they begin to separate and bending is less complex (mid-shaft), and where trabeculae extensively interconnect and loading is more complex (distal shaft). Of the eight trabecular architectural characteristics evaluated, only one (trabecular number, Tb.N) showed a probable mechanically relevant dorsal/plantar difference. However, this was paradoxically opposite in the sheep calcanei. Aside from Tb.N, the architectural characteristics showed little, if any, evidence of habitual bending. The non-uniformity of the stresses between the trabecular tracts in these bones might be reduced by load-sharing functions of their robust cortices and the nearby ligament and tendon, which might account for the similar morphologies between the tracts. These findings may help to explain why in many cases regional trabecular architectural variations seem to lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for interpreting habitual bending in other bone regions. This cautions against simple interpretations of trabecular bone adaptation in the anthropoid femoral neck.},

  abstract = {Sheep and deer calcanei are finding increased use as models for studies of bone adaptation, including advancing understanding of how the strain (deformation) environment influences the ontogenetic emergence of biomechanically relevant structural and material variations in cortical and trabecular bone. These artiodactyl calcanei seem ideal for these analyses because they function like simply loaded short-cantilevered beams with net compression and tension strains on the dorsal and plantar cortices, respectively. However, this habitual strain distribution requires more rigorous validation because it has been shown by limited in vivo and ex vivo strain measurements obtained during controlled ambulation (typically walking and trotting). The conception that these calcanei are relatively simply and habitually loaded ‘tension/compression bones’ could be invalid if infrequent, though biologically relevant, loads substantially change the location of the neutral axis (NA) that separates ‘compression’ and ‘tension’ regions. The effect on calcaneus strains of the tension members (plantar ligament and flexor tendon) is also not well understood and measuring strains after transecting them could reveal that they significantly modulate the strain distribution. We tested the hypothesis that the NA location previously described during simulated on-axis loads of deer calcanei would exhibit limited variations even when load perturbations are unusual (e.g. off-axis loads) or extreme (e.g. after transection of the tension members). We also examined regional differences in the predominance of the three strain modes (tension, compression, and shear) in these various load conditions in dorsal, plantar, medial, and lateral cortices. In addition to considering principal strains (tension and compression) and maximum shear strains, we also considered material-axis (M-A) shear strains. M-A shear strains are those that are aligned along the long axis of the bone and are considered to have greater biomechanical relevance than maximum shear strains because failure theories of composite materials and bone are often based on stresses or strains in the principal material directions. We used the same load apparatus from our prior study of mule deer calcanei. Results showed that although the NA rotated up to 8° medially and 15° laterally during these off-axis loads, it did not shift dramatically until after transection of all tension members. When comparing results based on maximum shear strain data vs. M-A shear strain data, the dominant strain mode changed only in the plantar cortex – as expected (in accordance with our a priori view) it was tension when M-A shear strains were considered (shear : tension = 0.2) but changed to dominant shear when maximum shear strain data were considered (shear : tension = 1.3). This difference leads to different conclusions and speculations regarding which specific strain modes and magnitudes most strongly influence the emergence of the marked mineralization and histomorphological differences in the dorsal vs. plantar cortices. Consequently, our prior simplification of the deer calcaneus model as a simply loaded ‘tension/compression bone’ (i.e. plantar/dorsal) might be incorrect. In vivo and in finite element analyses are needed to determine whether describing it as a ‘shear-tension/compression’ bone is more accurate. Addressing this question will help to advance the artiodactyl calcaneus as an experimental model for bone adaptation studies.},

  abstract = {The artiodactyl (mule deer) calcaneus was examined for structural and material features that represent regional differences in cortical bone modeling and remodeling activities. Cortical thickness, resorption and formation surfaces, mineral content (percent ash), and microstructure were quantified between and within skeletally immature and mature bones. These features were examined to see if they are consistent with predictions of Frost's Mechanostat paradigm of mechanically induced bone adaptation in a maturing “tension/compression” bone (Frost, 1990a,b, Anat Rec 226:403–413, 414–422). Consistent with Frost's hypothesis that surface modeling activities differ between the “compression” (cranial) and “tension” (caudal) cortices, the elliptical cross-section of the calcaneal diaphysis becomes more elongated in the direction of bending as a result of preferential ({$>$} 95\%) increase in thickness of the compression cortex. Regional differences in mineral content and population densities of new remodeling events (NREs = resorption spaces plus newly forming secondary osteons) support Frost's hypothesis that intracortical remodeling activities differ between the opposing cortices: 1.) in immature and mature bones, the compression cortex had attained a level of mineralization averaging 8.9 and 6.8\% greater (P {$<$} 0.001), respectively, than that of the tension cortex, and 2.) there are on average 350 to 400\% greater population densities of NREs in the tension cortices of both age groups (P {$<$} 0.0003). No significant differences in cortical thickness, mineral content, porosity, or NREs were found between medial and lateral cortices of the skeletally mature bones, suggesting that no modeling or remodeling differences exist along a theoretical neutral axis. However, in mature bones these cortices differed considerably in secondary osteon cross-sectional area and population density. Consistent with Frost's hypothesis, remodeling in the compression cortex produced bone with microstructural organization that differs from the tension cortex. However, the increased remodeling activity of the tension cortex does not appear to be related to a postulated low-strain environment. Although most findings are consistent with predictions of Frost's Mechanostat paradigm, there are several notable inconsistencies. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the nature of the mechanisms that govern the modeling and remodeling activities that produce and maintain normal bone. It is proposed that the artiodactyl calcaneus will provide a useful experimental model for these studies. Anat Rec 263:167–185, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Natural loading of the calcanei of deer, elk, sheep and horses produces marked regional differences in prevalent/predominant strain modes: compression in the dorsal cortex, shear in medial–lateral cortices, and tension/shear in the plantar cortex. This consistent non-uniform strain distribution is useful for investigating mechanisms that mediate the development of the remarkable regional material variations of these bones (e.g. collagen orientation, mineralization, remodeling rates and secondary osteon morphotypes, size and population density). Regional differences in strain-mode-specific microdamage prevalence and/or morphology might evoke and sustain the remodeling that produces this material heterogeneity in accordance with local strain characteristics. Adult calcanei from 11 animals of each species (deer, elk, sheep and horses) were transversely sectioned and examined using light and confocal microscopy. With light microscopy, 20 linear microcracks were identified (deer: 10; elk: six; horse: four; sheep: none), and with confocal microscopy substantially more microdamage with typically non-linear morphology was identified (deer: 45; elk: 24; horse: 15; sheep: none). No clear regional patterns of strain-mode-specific microdamage were found in the three species with microdamage. In these species, the highest overall concentrations occurred in the plantar cortex. This might reflect increased susceptibility of microdamage in habitual tension/shear. Absence of detectable microdamage in sheep calcanei may represent the (presumably) relatively greater physical activity of deer, elk and horses. Absence of differences in microdamage prevalence/morphology between dorsal, medial and lateral cortices of these bones, and the general absence of spatial patterns of strain-mode-specific microdamage, might reflect the prior emergence of non-uniform osteon-mediated adaptations that reduce deleterious concentrations of microdamage by the adult stage of bone development.},

  abstract = {Objectives The primate talus is known to have a shape that varies according to differences in locomotion and substrate use. While the modern human talus is morphologically specialized for bipedal walking, relatively little is known on how its morphology varies in relation to cultural and environmental differences across time. Here we compare tali of modern human populations with different subsistence economies and lifestyles to explore how cultural practices and environmental factors influence external talar shape. Materials and Methods The sample consists of digital models of 142 tali from 11 archaeological and post-industrial modern human groups. Talar morphology was investigated through 3D (semi)landmark based geometric morphometric methods. Results Our results show distinct differences between highly mobile hunter-gatherers and more sedentary groups belonging to a mixed post-agricultural/industrial background. Hunter-gatherers exhibit a more “flexible” talar shape, everted posture, and a more robust and medially oriented talar neck/head, which we interpret as reflecting long-distance walking strictly performed barefoot, or wearing minimalistic footwear, along uneven ground. The talus of the post-industrial population exhibits a “stable” profile, neutral posture, and a less robust and orthogonally oriented talar neck/head, which we interpret as a consequence of sedentary lifestyle and use of stiff footwear. Discussion We suggest that talar morphological variation is related to the adoption of constraining footwear in post-industrial society, which reduces ankle range of motion. This contrasts with hunter-gatherers, where talar shape shows a more flexible profile, likely resulting from a lack of footwear while traversing uneven terrain. We conclude that modern human tali vary with differences in locomotor and cultural behavior.},

  abstract = {Customary nonuniform distributions of physiological bone strains are thought to evoke heterogeneous material adaptation in diaphyseal cortices of some limb bones. Recent studies of artiodactyl calcanei have suggested that the regional prevalence of specific mechanical strain features such as mode and magnitude correlate with specific variations in cortical bone ultrastructure, microstructure and mineralization. These data are also consistent with predictions of current algorithms of mechanically induced bone adaptation. However, detailed characterization of the customary functional strain environment of these bones is needed to understand better the mechanisms of these adaptations.An in vitro loading method and rosette strain gauges were used to record principal strains, maximum shear strains and principal strain angles at multiple locations on ten calcanei of adult male mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus). Each hind limb was fixed in an apparatus to mimic the mid-support phase of the gait and loaded via the Achilles tendon over a broad range of functional loads (0 to 2943 N). Strains were recorded on the craniolateral, craniomedial, caudal, medial and lateral cortices at mid-diaphysis. Loading variations included the progressive elimination of the ligament and tendon along the caudal calcaneus.The results showed that the cranial cortex experiences longitudinal compressive strains that are nearly equal to the principal minimum strains and that the caudal cortex receives longitudinal tensile strains that are nearly equal to the principal maximum strains. With a 981 N load, the mean principal compressive strain on the cranial cortex was ?636±344 ?? (mean ± S.D., N=9) and the mean principal tensile strain on the caudal cortex was 1112±68 ?? (N=9). In contrast to the cranial and caudal cortices, principal strains in the medial and lateral cortices displayed relatively large deviations from the longitudinal axis (medial, 24 ° cranial; lateral, 27 ° caudal). Although shear strains predominated at all gauge sites, variations in maximum shear strains showed no apparent regional pattern or consistent regional predominance. The plantar ligament and tendon of the superficial digital flexor muscle were shown to have important load-sharing functions.These results demonstrate that the functionally loaded artiodactyl calcaneus generally behaves like a cantilevered beam with longitudinal compression and tension strains predominating in opposing cranial and caudal cortices, respectively. Differences in osteon remodeling rates, osteon morphology and mineral content reported previously between the cranial and caudal cortices correlate, in part, with the magnitudes of the principal compressive and tensile strains, respectively. However, material differences that distinguish the medial and lateral cortices from the cranial and caudal cortices could not be primarily attributed to locally increased shear strains as previously suggested. Variations in osteon and/or collagen fiber orientation may correlate more strongly with principal strain direction.},

This study examined the degree of anisotropy, the elongation, and primary orientation of trabecular bone in the KNM-ER 1464 Early Pleistocene hominin talus as compared with extant hominoid taxa. Modern human tali were found to have a pattern of relatively anisotropic and elongated trabeculae on the lateral aspect, which was not found in Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, or KNM-ER 1464. Trabecular anisotropy in the fossil talus most closely resembled that of the African apes except for a region of high anisotropy in the posteromedial talus. The primary orientation of trabeculae in the anteromedial region of KNM-ER 1464 was strikingly different from that of the great apes and very similar to that of modern humans in being directed parallel to the talar neck. These results suggest that, relative to that of modern humans, the anteromedial region of the KNM-ER 1464 talus may have transmitted body weight to the midfoot in a similar manner while the lateral aspect may have been subjected to more variable loading conditions.},

It can provide measurements with accuracy surpassing the underlying imaging resolution. CBM can detect changes in several properties of the cortex, with no prior assumptions about the likely location of said changes. This paper summarises the theory behind CBM, discusses its strengths and limitations, and reviews some studies in which it has been applied.},

  abstract = {The local structure of the proximal femoral cortex is of interest since both fracture risk, and the effects of various interventions aimed at reducing that risk, are associated with cortical properties focused in particular regions rather than dispersed over the whole bone. Much of the femoral cortex is less than 3mm thick, appearing so blurred in clinical CT that its actual density is not apparent in the data, and neither thresholding nor full-width half-maximum techniques are capable of determining its width. Our previous work on cortical bone mapping showed how to produce more accurate estimates of cortical thickness by assuming a fixed value of the cortical density for each hip. However, although cortical density varies much less over the proximal femur than thickness, what little variation there is leads to errors in thickness measurement. In this paper, we develop the cortical bone mapping technique by exploiting local estimates of imaging blur to correct the global density estimate, thus providing a local density estimate as well as more accurate estimates of thickness. We also consider measurement of cortical mass surface density and the density of trabecular bone immediately adjacent to the cortex. Performance is assessed with ex vivo clinical QCT scans of proximal femurs, with true values derived from high resolution HRpQCT scans of the same bones. We demonstrate superior estimation of thickness than is possible with alternative techniques (accuracy 0.12±0.39mm for cortices in the range 1–3mm), and that local cortical density estimation is feasible for densities {$>$}800mg/cm3.},

Using the first domesticated species, the dog (Canis familiaris), for illustration, we describe the evolutionary peculiarities during the historical domestication, such as the high level and wide range of diversity. We suggest that the process of earliest domestication via unconscious and later conscious selection of human-defined behavioral traits may accelerate phenotypic variations. The review is based on the results of a long-term experiment designed to reproduce early mammalian domestication in the silver fox (Vulpes vulpes) selected for tameability or amenability to domestication. We describe changes in behavior, morphology and physiology that appeared in the fox during its selection for tameability, which were similar to those observed in the domestic dog. Based on the data of the fox experiment and survey of relevant data, we discuss the developmental, genetic and possible molecular genetic mechanisms underlying these changes. We ascribe the causative role in evolutionary transformation of domestic animals to the selection for behavior and to the neurospecific regulatory genes it affects.},

  abstract = {An extraordinary sequence of fossiliferous levels at the locality of Gran Dolina in the Atapuerca Hills (Burgos, Spain) records the Early–Middle Pleistocene transition. These levels are well dated by a variety of methods, including palaeomagnetism, which locates Lower–Middle Pleistocene boundary at the top of level TD7. Level TD6 is the type site of the species Homo antecessor and yielded over 90\% of the European Early Pleistocene human record, while other levels have an archaeological record. The present paper deals with the earliest Middle Pleistocene ungulates of TD8, but we plan to describe the faunas, or at least the ungulates, of levels TD4 to TD8 in the context of the faunal changes that took place around the Early–Middle Pleistocene transition. About 600 fossils could be assigned to a taxon and on this basis the following ungulates are described from TD8: horse Equus altidens, rhinoceros Stephanorhinus aff. etruscus, wild boar Sus scrofa, hippopotamus Hippopotamus sp., red deer Cervus elaphus, giant deer Eucladoceros aff. giulii, giant deer Megaceroides solilhacus, fallow deer Dama vallonnetensis, and bison Bison voigtstedtensis. The evolution of these taxa is discussed. The fauna from level TD8 dates to the earliest Middle Pleistocene (stage 19) and differs from later faunas in the retention of a small rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus aff. etruscus) and the latest representative of the genus Eucladoceros. It differs from earlier faunas in having the striped hyaena. Together with the fauna from TD7, in which the Brunhes–Matuyama boundary is recorded, TD8 will provide the most precise criterions for correlation of the Early–Middle Pleistocene boundary on the basis of fossils of large mammals. Profound changes in the global climate system started to take place during the late Early Pleistocene, leading to intensive environmental and faunal change and to human dispersal into Europe. These events mark the beginning of a new time and the Early–Middle Pleistocene boundary is taken somewhere in the middle of this drawn out process. It is taken at a palaeomagnetic change, which is convenient, but this does not appear to be close to an important climatic or faunal change. Ten faunal events are recognized in the period from about 1.2 to 0.5~Ma. The event closest to the Early–Middle Pleistocene boundary is one of the minor events and up to now it is recorded in only few localities, principally in TD8.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to identify a series of conceptual, strategic and technological challenges facing archaeozoology (and archaeobotany) in order to better understand when, where, how and why plant and animal domestication and farming developed during the last 12 000 years. Situated at the interface of human societies and their environment, this reflection is based on examples, some of them unpublished, and on many references to animal domestication and husbandry in Eurasia, especially in East Asia, Southwest Asia and Cyprus. From a conceptual point of view, the author calls for an integrative systemic approach within the structural framework of the anthroposystem — a metasystem grouping societies and their environments, namely, their biodiversity. In order to tackle the full complexity of the system, equal attention must be paid to the biological, evolutionary and ecological components, as well as to the anthropological dynamics of human societies including technical, social and cultural aspects. To facilitate such an approach, this paper proposes a series of dynamic lines of research in order to explore the numerous gaps in our understanding of the beginnings of domestication and of the Neolithic transition, covering both causal factors and the diverse strategies developed by past societies. It pays special attention to the increasingly varied and cutting-edge technologies that can be used within these research projects, specifically quantitative data processing and databasing, direct radiocarbon dating of the bioarchaeological remains, traditional or geometric morphometrics, paleogenetics and paleogenomics, and sequential analyses of stable isotope ratios. More generally speaking, this paper aims to contribute to the development of an emerging and very promising interdisciplinary field of research.},

To determine this relationship, the factors controlling pig gait must be characterised. This study examined unprovoked pig gait on a concrete floor in clean conditions and compared it with gait in fouled floor conditions. Kinematics were used to record gait parameters such as walking speed, stride length, swing and stance time, stride elevation together with limb support phases, gait symmetry, diagonality and duty factor. On clean floors, pigs had an unprovoked symmetrical gait with alternating two- and three-beat support phases and a high rate of diagonality. Stride length, swing and stance time and stride elevation showed little variation. Pigs altered their gait in accordance with floor conditions to maintain gait control by reducing walking speed, lowering diagonality and employing more three-limb support phases. Pigs also shortened their stride length and prolonged their stance time.},

  abstract = {Captive specimens in museum collections facilitate study of rare taxa, but the lifestyles, diets, and lifespans of captive animals differ from their wild counterparts. Trabecular bone architecture adapts to in vivo forces, and may reflect interspecific variation in ecology and behavior as well as intraspecific variation between captive and wild specimens. We compared trunk vertebrae bone microstructure in captive and wild xenarthran mammals to test the effects of ecology and captivity. We collected ?CT scans of the last six presacral vertebrae in 13 fossorial, terrestrial, and suspensorial xenarthran species (body mass: 120 g to 35 kg). For each vertebra, we measured centrum length; bone volume fraction (BV.TV); trabecular number and mean thickness (Tb.Th); global compactness (GC); cross-sectional area; mean intercept length; star length distribution; and connectivity and connectivity density. Wild specimens have more robust trabeculae, but this varies with species, ecology, and pathology. Wild specimens of fossorial taxa (Dasypus) have more robust trabeculae than captives, but there is no clear difference in bone microstructure between wild and captive specimens of suspensorial taxa (Bradypus, Choloepus), suggesting that locomotor ecology influences the degree to which captivity affects bone microstructure. Captive Tamandua and Myrmecophaga have higher BV.TV, Tb.Th, and GC than their wild counterparts due to captivity-caused bone pathologies. Our results add to the understanding of variation in mammalian bone microstructure, suggest caution when including captive specimens in bone microstructure research, and indicate the need to better replicate the habitats, diets, and behavior of animals in captivity.},

  abstract = {Significance             Domestication of plants and animals marks a major transition in human history that represents a vibrant area of interdisciplinary scientific inquiry. Consideration of three central questions about domestication—what it is, what it does, and why it happened—provide a unifying framework for diverse research on the topic. Domestication is defined in terms of a coevolutionary mutualism between domesticator and domesticate and is distinguished from related but ultimately different processes of management and agriculture. Domestication results in a range of genotypic, phenotypic, plastic, and contextual impacts that can be used as markers of evolving domesticatory relationships. A consideration of causal scenarios finds greater empirical support for explanatory frameworks grounded in niche-construction theory over those derived from optimal foraging theory.           ,              The domestication of plants and animals is a key transition in human history, and its profound and continuing impacts are the focus of a broad range of transdisciplinary research spanning the physical, biological, and social sciences. Three central aspects of domestication that cut across and unify this diverse array of research perspectives are addressed here. Domestication is defined as a distinctive coevolutionary, mutualistic relationship between domesticator and domesticate and distinguished from related but ultimately different processes of resource management and agriculture. The relative utility of genetic, phenotypic, plastic, and contextual markers of evolving domesticatory relationships is discussed. Causal factors are considered, and two leading explanatory frameworks for initial domestication of plants and animals, one grounded in optimal foraging theory and the other in niche-construction theory, are compared.},

  abstract = {Jack Harlan was a polymath. His life-long study of crop evolution combined plant sciences, archaeology, systematics, genetics, and conservation, leaving a legacy of five decades of influential publications that explored all aspects of crop plants – their origins, their dispersal, and their continued and future role in supporting the Earth's burgeoning populations. To Harlan, agriculture was not an invention or the product of a single big idea. Instead, he saw agricultural origins in terms of a long co-evolutionary process involving humans and plants that grew out of “many independent tentatives in many locations that fused over time to produce effective food production systems” (Harlan 1995). Harlan's remarkable body of published work contains only one short encyclopedia entry on the subject of animal domestication (Harlan 1994). He was, in fact, somewhat dismissive of the contribution of animal domesticates to humankind's food supply stating that “(a)nimals are not essential, plants supply over 90\% of the food consumed by humans” (Harlan 1995). Jack Harlan would likely agree, however, that understanding livestock evolution requires the same breadth of focus that he brought to the study of crop evolution. Here I follow Harlan's example in a consideration of domestic animals, bringing together information from animal sciences, genetics, and archaeology to explore the multiple pathways leading to animal domestication and the implications of these pathways for current and future relationships between humans and their animal partners.Domestication as a processAll considerations of domestication, whether focusing on crops or livestock, acknowledge that it involves a two-way relationship between humans and target plant or animal populations. There is less unanimity in different conceptual approaches to domestication on whether emphasis should be placed on the human or the plant/animal side of the equation (see Zeder 2006a). Some cast humans as the dominant partner in a relationship in which humans consciously and with deliberate intent assume “mastery” over all aspects of the production, movement, feeding, and protection of the domesticate (Hale 1969, Ducos 1978, B?k?nyi 1989, Clutton-Brock 1994). Others see domestication as a form of biological mutualism in which both partners (humans and domesticate) reap benefits (O'Connor 1997). Some even contend that domesticates manipulated unwitting humans into relationships that gave the domesticate great evolutionary advantage at the expense of human fitness (Rindos 1984, Budiansky 1992, Morey 1994).},
